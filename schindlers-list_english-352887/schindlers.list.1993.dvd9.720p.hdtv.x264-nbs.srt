what kind of law it is.

74
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:55,205
As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

''We'll do this to avoid that.''

since thousands of years.

79
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:07,406
It's what they do.
They weather the storm.

But this storm is different.
This is not the Romans.
This storm is the SS.

Please. I only know
what they tell me.

111
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:42,009
And what they tell me
changes from day to day.

112
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:45,209
Aren't you supposed
to be able to help ?

113
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,408
I mean, what if I just
took this thing off?

114
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,209
What are they going
to do about it ?
They will shoot you.

115
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:55,410
Why don't you stop
this silly talk ?
Itzhak Stern !

116
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,709
I'm looking
for Itzhak Stern.

117
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:03,509
Are you Itzhak Stern
or not ?

118
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,609
I am.
Where can we talk ?

119
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:20,210
There's a company
you did the books for
on Lipowa Street.

120
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,709
Made what 
Pots and pans ?

121
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,809
By law, I have to tell you,
sir, I'm a Jew.

122
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,810
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

123
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:36,310
A good company,
you think ?
Modestly successful.

124
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:39,010
I know nothing
about enamelware.
Do you ?

125
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:41,510
I was just
the accountant.

126
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:44,011
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think ?

127
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,410
Change the machines around,
whatever you do,

128
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,911
you could make other
things, couldn't you ?

129
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:52,511
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

130
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:57,210
Once the war ends,
forget it, but for now
it's great.

131
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,511
You can make a fortune,
don't you think ?

132
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:02,911
I think most people right now
have other priorities.

133
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:05,911
Like what ?

134
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:08,411
I'm sure you'll do just fine
once you get the contracts.

135
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,611
In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

136
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:14,112
Oh, well, I can get
the signatures I need.
That's the easy part.

137
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:17,911
Finding the money
to buy the company,
that's hard.

138
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:19,911
You don't have
any money ?

139
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:24,111
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody ?

140
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:27,112
Jews, yeah.

141
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:30,111
Investors. You must
have contacts...

142
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:32,112
in theJewish
business community
working here.

143
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,012
What community ?
Jews can no longer
own businesses.

144
00:13:35,012 --> 00:13:38,113
That's why this one's
in receivership.
But they

145
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:41,013
I'd own it.
I'd pay them back in
product-- pots and pans.

146
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:44,011
Pots and pans.
Something
they can use.

147
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:46,012
Something they can
feel in their hands.

148
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:48,312
They can trade it
on the black market,
do whatever they want.

149
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,813
Everybody's happy.

150
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:55,312
If you want, you could
run the company for me.

151
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,613
Let me understand.

152
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:04,513
They'd put up all the money,
I'd do all the work.

153
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:07,812
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do ?

154
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:10,313
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

155
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:12,612
I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

156
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:16,514
That's what I'm good at,
not the work. Not the work.

157
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:19,013
The presentation.

158
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:41,413
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

159
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:45,814
Well, they should be,
Itzhak Stern.

160
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:49,714
Tell them they should be.

161
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:01,714
Achtung ! Achtung !

162
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:07,714
An alleJuden...
Ab sofort ist es verboten--

Domine Sancte, Pater Omnipotens,
Aeterne Deus.

166
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:23,916
I've got a client
who'll sell marks
for zloty at 2.45 to 1 .

167
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:26,316
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

168
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,315
She'll trade it
for ration coupons.

169
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:31,814
Wicks, for lamps.
You have a truckload
of wicks ?

170
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:36,015
What am I going to do
with a truckload of wicks ?
Nine by 1 2, nine by 1 4.

171
00:15:36,114 --> 00:15:39,115
I don't know.
Big, beautiful, Persian.

Lumen aeternum mundo effudit--

173
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:44,615
Psst.
What ?

174
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:46,615
You don't recognize this ?
It's shoe polish.

175
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:49,116
In metal containers ?
You asked
for shoe polish.

176
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,516
In metal containers.
This is glass.
In metal containers.

177
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:53,516
It's not what I asked for.
What's
the difference ?

178
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:55,515
What's the difference 
What's the difference ?

179
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:57,616
Shh.!
My client sold it

180
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,616
who sold it
to the German Army.

181
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:04,116
Only by the time it got there,
because of the freezing cold,
it broke. All 1 0,000 units.

182
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:06,416
Mmm,
ooh, ooh, ooh.
This is not my problem.

183
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:08,515
This is not
his problem.
This is not your problem ?

184
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:11,116
This is not
my problem.
All right.

185
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:15,116
The German Army
wants to find out
where it came from.

186
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:18,617
I am going to make sure
they find out.
Now it's your problem.

187
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:21,816
You be quiet !

00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,517
Hello.

190
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:31,617
Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

191
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:34,017
Nice shirt.

192
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:37,316
Do you know where
I can find a nice
shirt like that ?

193
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:43,317
...laudare, benedicere
et predicare.

194
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:47,017
Like this ?

195
00:16:47,116 --> 00:16:50,117
It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

196
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:53,518
We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

197
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:58,317
Jesum Christum Dominum Nostrum--

198
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:03,318
Do you have any idea how much
a shirt like this costs ?
Nice things cost money.

199
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,618

How many ?

203
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:22,919
I'm going to need
some other things, too,
as things come up.

204
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:27,218
This won't be
a problem.
From time to time.

205
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:30,318

This is obviously the right
place. How are you doing ?

Oh, my God.

222
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:17,822
Oy, God.
Oh, my God.

223
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,523
Oh, my God.

224
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:35,723
It could not be better.

225
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:39,524
It could be worse.
How ? Tell me.

226
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:42,523
How on earth could it
possibly be worse ?

227
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:47,323
Dzien dobry.

228
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:49,723
Dzien dobry.
Dzien dobry.

229

Dzien dobry.

00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:54,124
Dzien dobry.
Dzien dobry.

231
00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:59,523
Hey, Goldberg.
Poldek.

232
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:03,924
What's this ?
Uh, the Judenrat has
its own police now.

233
00:21:04,024 --> 00:21:06,824
You don't say.
Ordnungsdienst.

234
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:09,424
I'm a policeman now,
could you believe it ?
It's hard to believe.

235
00:21:09,524 --> 00:21:11,524
Oh, no,
it's not hard
to believe.

236
00:21:11,524 --> 00:21:14,025
It's a good racket, Poldek.
The only racket here.

237
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:17,524
Look, maybe I could
put in a good word for you
with my superiors.

238
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:21,824
Your superiors ?
Come on, they are not
as bad as everyone says.

239
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:25,125
Well, they're worse
than everyone says,
but it's a lot of money.

240
00:21:25,224 --> 00:21:27,824
A lot of money.

241
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:30,625
Give me my
housing assignment.

242
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:35,125
Come on.
You look funny
in that hat, Goldberg.

243
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:38,625
You look like a clown,
you know ?

244
00:21:43,624 --> 00:21:46,025
He's a very important man.

245
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:47,824
Just give him
two minutes of your time.

246
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:51,325
Since when did time cost money ?
Just sit down and listen.

247
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:53,625
Please.
Sir ?

248
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:59,426
For each thousand you invest,
I will repay you with...

249
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:01,626
Two hundred.
200 kilos
of enamelware a month,

250
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:03,625
to begin in July
and to continue
for one year.

251
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:07,526
After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.

252
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,525
Not good enough.
It's not
good enough.

253
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:12,827
Not good enough ?

254
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:17,025
Look where you're living.
Look where you've been put.
''Not good enough.''

255
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,626
A couple of months ago you'd
be right, not anymore.

256
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:22,825
Money's still money.

257
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,727
No, it is not.

258
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,826
That's why we're here.

259
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:30,926
Trade goods--
that's the only currency...

260
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:32,926
that'll be worth
anything in the ghetto.

261
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:36,327
Things have changed,
my friend.

262
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:39,526
Did I call
this meeting ?

263
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:42,025
You told Mr. Stern
you wanted to speak to me.

264
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,727
I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.

265
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:48,726
Fair would be
a percentage in the company.

266
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:52,026
Forget the whole thing.

267
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:54,426
Get out.

268
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,726
How do we know that you
will do what you say ?

269
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:03,727
Because I said I would.

270
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:06,027
You want a contract 
To be upheld by what court ?

271
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:09,027
I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

272
00:23:12,427 --> 00:23:14,627
...mielismy racje.

273
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:31,727
Piec, szesc, siedem...

274
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,428
osiem, dziewiec.

275
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:51,228
The standard SS rate for
Jewish skilled labor
is seven marks a day,

276
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:54,228
five for unskilled
and women.

277
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:57,328
This is what you pay
the Reich Economic Office.

278
00:23:57,429 --> 00:23:59,928
TheJews themselves
receive nothing.

279
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:04,429
Poles you pay wages.
Generally, they get
a little more.

280
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:07,128
Are you
listening 
What was that about the SS ?

281
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:09,430
The rate  The what ?

282
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:13,129
TheJewish worker's salary--
you pay it directly to
the SS, not to the worker.

283
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:15,328
He gets nothing.
But it's less.

284
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,429
It's less than what
I would pay a Pole.
It's less.

285
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:20,428
That's the point
I'm trying to make.

286
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:23,130
Poles cost more.

287
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:27,829
Why should I hire Poles ?

288
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:31,829
An enamelware factory
over at, uh, Lipowa Street.

289
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,829
It, uh, it, um--
It's owned by a German.

290
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:38,030
But it's outside
the ghetto, so you can
barter for extra goods--

291
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,329
for eggs, I don't know
what you need--

292
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:42,530
with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

293
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,829
Also, he's asking for ten
healthy women for the--
I am healthy.

294
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,929
Bring your sister, okay ?

295
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,630
Chodz.

296
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,130
You need to convince them
you have a trade, something
valuable to the war effort.

297
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:02,429
Like what 
What if you don't ?
I'm a musician.

298
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:06,130
Your name goes
on a list.
And they put you on trucks--

299
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,330
No, no, no,
that's not true.
You're a musician ?

300
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:10,931
Yeah.
I'd fid a good
hiding place if I were you.

301
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,530
I'm not going to hide
like some animal.
There are places to hide.

302
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,030
Der Naechste.!

303
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:25,531
I'm a graduate
of the University of Lwow.

304
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:28,832
I used to work at the
hydroelectric station
in Roznow--

305
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:30,831
Blauschein.

306
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:38,032
I'm gonna get the necessary
papers because this card
is no good anymore.

307
00:25:38,131 --> 00:25:40,531
You can stay in this line
all day, you'll still get
one of these.

308
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:44,331
They are no good.
You'll have to leave
the line now,

309
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:49,031
then you'll get a blue card,
a Blauschein, to say that
you are an essential worker.

310
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,231
I'll get these papers
for you at Pankiewicz.

311
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:54,231
Pharmacist.
Just there, look.

312
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:56,232
Guess who is here ?

313
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:59,031
Poldek ! Enjoying
the weather, Poldek ?

314
00:25:59,132 --> 00:26:02,132
Enjoying the lines 
Need some shoe polish ?

315
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:04,731
In a metal container
maybe ?

316
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:09,232
Not essential ?
I think you misunderstand
the meaning of the word.

317
00:26:09,332 --> 00:26:12,232
No Blauschein, sir.
Stand over there.

318
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:15,131
Move. Next !

319
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:17,433
What do you mean,
''Not essential'' ?

320
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:23,232
I teach history and literature.
Since when is not essential ?

321
00:26:28,532 --> 00:26:30,933
He's a metal polisher.

322
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:40,633
It was not right ?
It's very good.
He's 53 years old.

323
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,833
It's too new.
Mmm.
Thank you.

324
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:54,533
You're crazy.
You left it
in your drawer.

325
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:56,832
How many times
have I told you ?

326
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:59,633
Your work certificate
you keep in your pocket
at all times.

327
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:01,633
And you leave everything
in your drawer.

328
00:27:01,734 --> 00:27:04,133
How many times I've told you ?

329
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:07,433
I'm a metal polisher.

330
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,834
Take the round sheet of tin,

331
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:22,834
dip it in soap emulsion.

332
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:28,033
Then place it centrally
in the press.

333
00:27:43,235 --> 00:27:46,634
We obtain the soup pot.
The soup pot.

334
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:50,134
Soup pot.

335
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,335
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz,
stay together.

336
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:02,835
Sir, I have ten work permits
here for the Deutsche
Emailwarenfabrik,

337
00:28:02,835 --> 00:28:05,735
cosigned by Mr. Bankier
and myself.

338
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:10,435
If it's carbonized,
clean it with a file.

339
00:28:10,534 --> 00:28:15,335
But don't touch
both the electrodes
at the same time.

340
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:18,536
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

341
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:25,335
Roll the metal
under the press,

342
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:27,835
but be very careful
unless you want your fingers...

343
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:30,736
to become part
of the teapot.

344
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:36,036
Occupation ?
I'm a writer.
I play the flute.

345
00:28:36,036 --> 00:28:39,535
But Moses is
a skilled metalworker.

346
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:41,836
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

347
00:28:41,935 --> 00:28:43,836
He can make whatever
Mr. Schindler asks.

348
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:46,536
He's highly skilled.
Give him your card.

349
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:48,935
Moses, give him your card.

350
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:53,336
Now, dip the basin
with the tongs...

351
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:55,937
into the enamel solution.

352
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:02,437
And after swiveling it around,
carefully place it aside
to drip dry.

353
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:08,937
And whatever he asks you,
allow me just to represent
you and speak for you.

354
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:11,037
Don't say a word.

355
00:29:11,136 --> 00:29:14,638
Filing, billing, keeping track
of my appointments, shorthand.

356
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:18,936
Typing, obviously.
How is your typing ?
Uh, all right.

357
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:20,937
Please.

358
00:30:13,838 --> 00:30:17,539
You need a secretary.
Pick one.

359
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:22,538
I don't know how.
They're all so...
qualified.

360
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:25,539
You have to choose.

361
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,639
Prosze sie ladnie usmiechac.
Big smile.
Big smile.

362
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:32,139
Uwaga.

363
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,538
####

364
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,540
If you would,
look after my guest.

365
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:59,939
Um, boxed teas are good.
Coffiee, pate, um...

366
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:04,140
kielbasa sausage,
cheeses, Beluga caviar.
Yes.

367
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,040
And, of course, who could live
without German cigarettes ?

368
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,339
Get me as many
as you can fid.

369
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,540
And some more fresh fruit.

370
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,440
The real rarities--
oranges, lemons, pineapples.

371
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,240
I need several boxes
of Cuban cigars. The best.
Yes.

372
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,040
And dark, unsweetened chocolate.
Not in the shape ofladyfigers,
the chunk chocolate.

373
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,239
Yes.
Big as my hand,
you sample at wine tastings.

374
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:26,540
We're going to need lots
of cognac. The best, Hennessy.

375
00:31:26,641 --> 00:31:32,040
Dom Perignon champagne.
Um, get L 'espadon sardines...

376
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,141
and, oh,
try to fid nylon stockings.

377
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,841
It is my distinct pleasure
to announce...

378
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,541
the fully operational status
of Deutsche Email Fabrik...

379
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:47,940
Patrzjakies szmaty.!

380
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,441
manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery...

381
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:56,941
expressly designed
and crafted for military use.

382
00:31:56,941 --> 00:31:59,641
Utilizing only
the most modern equipment,

383
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:04,841
D.E.F. 's staffi of
highly-skilled and experienced
artisans andjourneymen...

384
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:08,442
deliver a product
of unparalleled quality,

385
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:12,442
enabling me to proffier,
with absolute confidence
and pride,

386
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:15,142
a full line
of field and kitchenware...

387
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:19,341
unsurpassable in all respects
by my competitors.

388
00:32:19,442 --> 00:32:22,042
See attached list
and available colors.

389
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:26,942
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval.

390
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:30,841
Made in Havana, Cuba.
Looking forward to a long and
mutually prosperous association.

391
00:32:30,943 --> 00:32:34,143
Look at this.
I extend to you in advance
my sincerest gratitude...

392
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:37,141
and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.

393
00:32:37,243 --> 00:32:40,642
Yeah, I need 700 gross
from here for next Thursday.

394
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:43,543
Nine hundred--
No, make it ten
for Wednesday.

395
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:47,442
All this stuff here goes
to Madritsch's factory
on Tuesday of next week.

396
00:33:03,243 --> 00:33:06,643
My father was fond of saying,
''You need three things in life

397
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:10,843
''a good doctor,
a forgiving priest...

398
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:14,144
and a clever accountant. ''

399
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:21,643
The first two... 
I've never had much use for.

400
00:33:21,743 --> 00:33:25,143
But the third--

401
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:33,943
Just pretend,
for Christ's sake.

402
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:40,844
Is that all ?

403
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:48,843
I'm trying to thank you.

404
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:53,143
I'm saying I couldn't
have done this without you.

405
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:58,545
The usual thing would be
to acknowledge my gratitude.

406
00:33:58,644 --> 00:34:03,546
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

407
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:06,445
You're welcome.

408
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,545
Get out of here.

409
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:34,145
Klonowska, who is it ?

410
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:46,145
She's so embarrassed.
Look at her.

411
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:00,446
You know something ?
You would like her.

412
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:02,446
Oskar, please.
What ?

413
00:35:02,545 --> 00:35:04,945
I don't have to like her...
just because you do.
You would, though.

414
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:07,845
It doesn't
work that way.

415
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:23,446
You've done well here.

416
00:35:25,848 --> 00:35:28,446
You look wonderful.

417
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:34,847
Be careful
of the step, miss.
Mrs. Schindler, Marek.

418
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:47,447
## 

419
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:51,547
It's not a charade,
all this ?
How could it

420
00:35:51,547 --> 00:35:54,048
The clothes, the car,
the apartment.
Wait a minute.

421
00:35:54,048 --> 00:35:58,048
Take a guess how many
people are on my payroll.
Oskar.

422
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:03,848
My father, at the height
of his success, had 50.
I've got 3 50.

423
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:08,148
3 50 workers
on the factory floor,
with one purpose.

424
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:10,447
To make pots and pans ?

425
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:14,547
To make money.
For me.

426
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:23,449
Does anyone
ask about me ?

427
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:28,148
Back home ?
Everybody.

428
00:36:28,249 --> 00:36:31,148
All the time.

429
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:34,549
Hmm.

430
00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:40,148
They won't soon forget
the name Schindler here,
I can tell you that.

431
00:36:41,648 --> 00:36:44,850
''Oskar Schindler,''
they'll say.

432
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:48,349
''Everybody
remembers him.

433
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:52,849
''He did something
extraordinary.

434
00:36:52,948 --> 00:36:58,049
''He did something
no one else did.

435
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,449
''He came here
with nothing--

436
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:04,448
''a suitcase--

437
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:10,149
''and built a bankrupt
company into a major
manufactory.

438
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:13,749
''And left with
a steamer trunk--

439
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,450
''Two steamer trunks
full of money,

440
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,850
all the riches
of the world.''

441
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,849
Hmm.

442
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:28,150
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

443
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,851
You're wrong, Emilie.

444
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:34,350
There's no way I could have
known this before,

445
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,850
but there was always
something missing.

446
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,950
In every business I tried,
I can see now, it wasn't me
that failed.

447
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,850
Something was missing.

448
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,451
Even if I'd known what it
was, there's nothing I could
have done about it...

449
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:53,150
because you can't
create this thing.

450
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:58,550
And it makes all
the difference in the world
between success and failure.

451
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,151
Luck ?

452
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:06,451
War.

453
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:33,651
Should I stay ?

454
00:38:33,752 --> 00:38:38,552
It's a beautiful city.

455
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:43,552
I asked you
if I should stay.

456
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:46,652
It's up to you.

457
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:55,153
Promise me, Oskar,
no doorman or maitre d'
will ever presume...

458
00:38:55,252 --> 00:39:00,653
I'm anyone other
than Mrs. Schindler,
and I'll stay.

459
00:39:02,852 --> 00:39:05,152
Good-bye, darling.

460
00:39:21,753 --> 00:39:25,953
I could try to read this
or I could eat my lunch
while it's still hot.

461
00:39:26,053 --> 00:39:28,053
We're doing well ?

462
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:29,353
Yes.
Better this month
than last ?

463
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:31,753
Yes.
Any reason
to think next month

464
00:39:31,753 --> 00:39:35,053
The war could end.

465
00:39:44,954 --> 00:39:47,553
What ?
There is a machinist
outside...

466
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:50,654
who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

467
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:55,454
Every day he comes.
He's very grateful.
It'll just take a minute.

468
00:40:01,754 --> 00:40:04,154
Mr. Lowenstein ?

469
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:14,254
I want to thank you, sir,

470
00:40:14,254 --> 00:40:17,054
for giving me
the opportunity to work.

471
00:40:17,154 --> 00:40:20,055
You're welcome.
I'm sure you're doing
a great job.

472
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:24,455
The SS beat me up.
They would have killed me,

473
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:29,255
but I am essential
to the war effort,
thanks to you.

474
00:40:29,255 --> 00:40:31,254
That's great.

475
00:40:31,254 --> 00:40:33,956
I work hard for you.

476
00:40:33,956 --> 00:40:38,056
I'm sure you do.
I'll continue
to work hard for you.

477
00:40:38,155 --> 00:40:40,055
That's great.
Thanks.

478
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:42,655
God bless you, sir.
All right.

479
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:46,456
You are a good man.

480
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:50,955
He saved my life.
Yes, he did.

481
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:53,855
God bless him.
Yeah.
Come on.

482
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:58,756
God bless you.

483
00:41:10,756 --> 00:41:13,656
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor,
but you're running very late.

484
00:41:13,755 --> 00:41:17,056
This is for the
Obersturmbannfuehrer, sir.

485
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,056
And this is for his niece,
Greta. It's her birthday.

486
00:41:20,056 --> 00:41:22,856
Greta as in Garbo.
By the way, don't ever
do that to me again.

487
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:25,556
Go. Go, go, drive !
Don't bow.

488
00:41:25,556 --> 00:41:29,556
Did you happen to notice that
that man had one arm 
What  Did he ?

489
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,856
What's his use ?
Very useful.

490
00:41:38,557 --> 00:41:42,256
How ?
Very useful ! Success !

491
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:54,857
##Achrar kach loe nedah ##

492
00:42:10,157 --> 00:42:13,357
Besen und Schaufeln
werden ausgeladen...

493
00:42:13,357 --> 00:42:16,058
jeder nimmt sich eine und dann
wird die Strasse gereinigt.

494
00:42:16,157 --> 00:42:18,358
We'll be late for work.

495
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:33,758
You shouldn't think of them
as yours, Oskar.

496
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,758
You need to understand that
some of the officers here...

497
00:42:35,758 --> 00:42:38,558
don't give a damn
about production.

498
00:42:38,658 --> 00:42:42,757
To them, it's a matter of,
um, national priority...

499
00:42:42,757 --> 00:42:45,158
thatJews
be made to shovel snow.

500
00:42:45,158 --> 00:42:47,758
It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar.

501
00:42:47,758 --> 00:42:49,858
You know it and I know it.

502
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:52,259
Jews shoveling snow--

503
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:57,059
It's got a, um,
ritual significance.

504
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,158
Come with me.
I am an essential worker.

505
00:43:02,259 --> 00:43:04,959
Essential worker ?
Yes.

506
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:11,459
I work for Oskar Schindler.
Essential worker
for Oskar Schindler.

507
00:43:11,558 --> 00:43:14,958
A one-armed Jew ?
Twice as useless !
Yes, yes.

508
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,059
I lost a day
of production, Rolf.

509
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:22,359
I work for Oskar Schindler.

510
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,458
Danka, look at the snow.
Look at the snow.
Look at the snow !

511
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,359
I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.

512
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,360
File a grievance
with the Economic Office.
It's your right.

513
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:40,161
Would it do
any good ?
Of course not.

514
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,361
A big shot from the SS Budget
and Construction Office
came to lunch...

515
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:51,060
and he told us that to believe
theJewish skilled worker
had a place...

516
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,560
in Reich economics
was a treasonable idea.

517
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:03,860
A one-armed machinist, Oskar ?

518
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,361
He was
a metal press operator.

519
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:13,160
Quite skilled.

520
00:44:42,161 --> 00:44:44,361
Herr Direktor?

521
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:46,762
Shit.
I don't believe it.

522
00:44:46,762 --> 00:44:49,062
Stern, is that you ?

523
00:44:49,162 --> 00:44:53,362
No, it's Poldek.
It's about Stern.

524
00:44:53,362 --> 00:44:57,262
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

525
00:44:57,262 --> 00:44:59,363
Clearly label it.

526
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:03,662
Given name first,
then your surname.

527
00:45:03,762 --> 00:45:06,363
Do not bring
your baggage with you.

528
00:45:06,462 --> 00:45:09,361
It will follow you later.

529
00:45:09,462 --> 00:45:12,663
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

530
00:45:12,762 --> 00:45:14,763
Clearly label it.

531
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:18,761
Lassen Sie Ihr Gepaeck
am Bahnsteig.

532
00:45:19,662 --> 00:45:21,663
Stern ?

533
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,862
He's on the list.
He is ?

534
00:45:26,963 --> 00:45:29,863
Well, let's find him.
I'm sorry.
You can't have him.

535
00:45:29,962 --> 00:45:32,863
He's on the list.
If he were an essential worker,
he would not be on the list.

536
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,663
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name ?

537
00:45:35,763 --> 00:45:38,863
Sir, the list
is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list.

538
00:45:38,964 --> 00:45:43,064
I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.

539
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:45,363
Tauber.

540
00:45:45,463 --> 00:45:49,363
Hauptscharfuehrer,
this gentleman thinks
a mistake's been made.

541
00:45:49,363 --> 00:45:51,863
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

542
00:45:51,963 --> 00:45:54,064
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production...

543
00:45:54,163 --> 00:45:56,364
and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

544
00:45:56,464 --> 00:45:58,763
Achtung, dieser Zug
faehrt jetzt ab.

545
00:45:58,763 --> 00:46:02,964
Is he on the list ?
Yes, sir.
Itzhak Stern.

546
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:08,663
Well, the list
is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.

547
00:46:08,763 --> 00:46:11,763
What is your name ?
Close and secure all doors.

548
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:15,364
My name ?
My name is Kunder.
This train is now leaving.

549
00:46:15,364 --> 00:46:17,864
Kunder.
Hauptscharfuehrer Kunder.

550
00:46:17,864 --> 00:46:19,864
K-U-N-D-E-R.
And what's yours ?

551
00:46:19,864 --> 00:46:22,064
Schindler.
S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

552
00:46:22,164 --> 00:46:24,464
Gentlemen,
thank you very much.

553
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:27,163
I think I can guarantee you
you'll both be in...

554
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:30,964
Southern Russia before the
end of the month. Good day.

555
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:34,064
Zamykac dokladnie drzwi.
Dokladnie zamykac drzwi.

556
00:46:34,064 --> 00:46:36,165
Stern !

557
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:38,164
Stern !
Stern !

558
00:46:38,265 --> 00:46:40,165
Itzhak Stern !

559
00:46:46,565 --> 00:46:49,164
Stern !
Itzhak Stern !

560
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:52,064
Stern.! Stern.!
Itzhak Stern.!

561
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:54,665
Stern !

562
00:46:54,765 --> 00:46:56,664
Sir ?

563
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,066
Stern !
Herr Direktor.

564
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:03,966
My apologies.

565
00:47:04,065 --> 00:47:06,964
Stop the train !
He's here !
I apologize.

566
00:47:07,065 --> 00:47:12,066
- Stop the train !
- Stop the train ! Stop it !

567
00:47:24,566 --> 00:47:28,366
Sign here.
Initial there.

568
00:47:28,466 --> 00:47:32,566
Makes no difference
to us, you understand.
This one, that one.

569
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:35,167
It's the inconvenience
to the list.

570
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:39,066
It's the paperwork.
I somehow left
my work card at home.

571
00:47:39,066 --> 00:47:42,866
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but--

572
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:47,066
I'm sorry, it was stupid !
What if I got here
five minutes later ?

573
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:49,867
Then where would I be ?

574
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,970
Shechel.

575
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,969
Sacrean,
sacrean end tzukeer.

576
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,569
Tzukeer end sacrean.

577
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,869
I woke up from a dream
this morning.

578
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,169
I was broke and sharing a room
with 1 2 people I didn't know,

579
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:53,571
only to discover
I was broke and sharing a room
with 1 2 people I didn't know.

580
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:57,070
You laugh about it ?
I have to laugh.

581
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,070
You are living
behind walls.

582
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:04,870
The walls I can deal with.
It's the restrictions
to my life I'm tired of.

583
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:08,069
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

584
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,870
I like it here.
There's a kind of,
I don't know,

585
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,270
ancestral squalor
to it all.

586
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,570
You are a slave
to these people.
No one envies us anymore.

587
00:50:15,671 --> 00:50:17,771
I'm smart.
Oh, yes,
you're smart.

588
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:20,070
You're
a real genius.
You had your chance.

589
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:24,871
Today,
today I actually found time
to organize a thought.

590
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:27,770
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

591
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,771
When's the last time
we did this ?

592
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:32,172
When's the last time
we stood around and talked ?

593
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:35,571
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

594
00:50:35,671 --> 00:50:37,971
No one took my business
away from me.

595
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:40,070
You don't really have
a business to take.

596
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:42,470
There's nowhere
down from here.

597
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,771
This is it.
This is the bottom.

598
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:48,571
The ghetto is... liberty.

599
00:50:54,771 --> 00:50:58,070
This street
divides the ghetto
just about in half.

600
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:03,571
civil employees,

601
00:51:03,571 --> 00:51:06,572
industrial workers
and so on.

602
00:51:06,572 --> 00:51:11,572
surplus labor,

603
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:14,072
the elderly
and infirm mostly.

604
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:17,172
Which is where you'll
want to start, huh ?

605
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:19,172
Do you have any
questions, sir?

606
00:51:19,272 --> 00:51:22,872
Ja, why is the top down ?
I'm fucking freezing.

607
00:51:25,072 --> 00:51:27,772
We expect a labor force
of 25,000 to 30,000.

608
00:51:27,772 --> 00:51:30,872
Segregated, of course.
The men in the barracks
near the quarry.

609
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:32,272
The women on the other
side of the wire.

610
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:34,873
My place is where ?
There, sir.

611
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:38,372
There 
You call that a villa ?
Yes, the villa.

612
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:40,771
Their synagogue,
can you see it ?
That's not a villa.

613
00:51:40,873 --> 00:51:44,173
We're planning to turn it
into the camp stables.
It's a house.

614
00:51:44,273 --> 00:51:48,073
What's that over there ?

615
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:50,973
Kindergarten.
Fifty-one.

616
00:51:50,973 --> 00:51:55,573
And we have
a dentist, shoemaker,
practical physicians.

617
00:51:57,673 --> 00:52:01,372
There they are, sir.

618
00:52:01,372 --> 00:52:04,473
Hmm.

619
00:52:04,573 --> 00:52:08,974
One of you is, uh,
a very lucky girl.

620
00:52:09,073 --> 00:52:12,873
There is an opening
for a job,

621
00:52:12,873 --> 00:52:16,873
away from all this...
backbreaking work,

622
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:20,474
at my new villa.

623
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:25,173
Uh, which of you has...

624
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:28,074
domestic experience ?

625
00:52:30,974 --> 00:52:35,174
Ja, on second thought,
I don't really want
someone else's maid.

626
00:52:35,275 --> 00:52:38,674
All those annoying habits
I have to undo.

627
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:46,375
I don't want
to give you my cold.

628
00:52:46,474 --> 00:52:48,674
Uh, what's your name ?

629
00:52:48,775 --> 00:52:51,074
Helen Hirsch.
What ?

630
00:52:51,174 --> 00:52:53,075
Helen Hirsch.

631
00:52:53,174 --> 00:52:57,474
What ?
I can't hear.
Helen Hirsch.

632
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:15,875
Ja.
Take it all down.!

633
00:53:15,975 --> 00:53:18,375
To work.!

634
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:22,876
Take it down.!
It is not safe.!

635
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:25,675
She says
the foundation was poured wrong.
She's got to take it down.

636
00:53:25,775 --> 00:53:28,875
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

637
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:33,276
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch !

638
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:37,576
Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation...

639
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:40,375
has to be torn down
and repoured.

640
00:53:40,476 --> 00:53:43,875
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence...

641
00:53:43,976 --> 00:53:46,576
at the southern end
of the barracks.

642
00:53:46,676 --> 00:53:49,276
Subsidence,
and then collapse.

643
00:53:49,276 --> 00:53:52,077
And you are
an engineer ?
Yes.

644
00:53:52,176 --> 00:53:54,576
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate...

645
00:53:54,675 --> 00:53:57,276
of Civil Engineering
from the University of Milan.

646
00:53:57,377 --> 00:54:01,176
Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

647
00:54:08,877 --> 00:54:12,176
Unterscharfuehrer.!
Jawohl?

648
00:54:12,277 --> 00:54:16,476
Shoot her.
What ?

649
00:54:16,577 --> 00:54:21,177
Herr Kommandant,
I'm only trying to do my job.

650
00:54:21,277 --> 00:54:23,177
Ja, I'm doing mine.

651
00:54:23,278 --> 00:54:25,377
But, sir,
she's foreman
of construction.

652
00:54:25,377 --> 00:54:27,877
We are not going
to have arguments
with these people.

653
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:29,877
Okay.

654
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:34,877
No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.

655
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:48,177
It will take
more than that.

656
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:51,578
I'm sure you're right.

657
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:02,477
Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

658
00:55:02,577 --> 00:55:06,178
We have more to see,
but we have only one more
hour of light.

659
00:55:08,577 --> 00:55:12,378
## 

660
00:55:17,578 --> 00:55:21,678
Today is history.

661
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:25,179
Today will be remembered.

662
00:55:25,278 --> 00:55:31,179
Years from now, the young
will ask with wonder...

663
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:33,678
about this day.

664
00:55:33,778 --> 00:55:38,778
Today is history,
and you are part of it.

665
00:55:38,778 --> 00:55:41,878
Six hundred years ago...

666
00:55:41,979 --> 00:55:44,380
## 

667
00:55:44,479 --> 00:55:48,579
when elsewhere they were footing
the blame for the Black Death,
Kazimierz the Great, so-called,

668
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:51,879
##Ke laolam chasedo ##
told theJews
they could come to Krakow.

669
00:55:51,879 --> 00:55:55,079
Chaja, bread.
They came.

670
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,379
Not that fat. No, less.
They trundled their belongings
into the city.

671
00:55:58,479 --> 00:56:00,379
Yes, a bit less.
They settled.

672
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,980
They took hold.
They prospered...

673
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:11,179
in business, science,
education, the arts.

674
00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:13,980
They came here with nothing.

675
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,379
####
Nothing.

676
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,279
And they flourished.

677
00:56:20,279 --> 00:56:26,080
For six centuries
there has been a Jewish Krakow.

678
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,380
Think about that.

679
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:31,380
By this evening,

680
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,580
those six centuries
are a rumor.

681
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,581
They never happened.

682
00:56:39,581 --> 00:56:43,380
Today is history.

683
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,281
Absitzen und in Zweierreihen
antreten.!

684
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,281
Kameraden.!
Schneller.!

685
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:17,482
I think we will start...
with Ghetto B.

686
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:20,781
Hopp, hopp, hopp, hopp.!

687
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:28,681
All right 
Start from
both sides ?

688
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:30,881
I would like you
to start there.
The right side ?

689
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:33,583
The right side, yeah.
And then move around.
Okay.

690
00:57:35,682 --> 00:57:40,082
Beschriften Sie es deutlich.
Es wird Ihnen nachgeschickt.

691
00:57:42,682 --> 00:57:45,382
Lassen Sie
Ihr Gepaeck stehen.

692
00:57:45,482 --> 00:57:49,282
Beschriften Sie es deutlich.

693
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:52,882
Es wird Ihnen nachgeschickt.

694
00:57:52,983 --> 00:57:55,483
Aufmachen !

Yes, Chaim Gold.

704
00:59:24,784 --> 00:59:27,286
Shoot him.

Nie zabijaj.!
Nie zabijaj.!

706
00:59:35,884 --> 00:59:39,085
Ziehen Sie warme Kleidung an
und begeben Sie sich zum Platz--

707

Gehen Sie durch.!
Keine Koffier.! Keine Koffier.!

709
00:59:46,585 --> 00:59:49,386
Hey, little boy.
Wie alt bist du, huh ?

710
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:53,286
Na, wie hiesst du 
Wie heisst du, huh ?

715
01:00:04,886 --> 01:00:07,186
Was soll
der Koffier hier?

716
01:00:07,285 --> 01:00:10,386
Alles 'rueber
zum Platz Chodi.!

717
01:00:26,086 --> 01:00:27,886
We're getting out
through the sewers.

718
01:00:27,886 --> 01:00:30,687
I have to check
if they're clear.

719
01:00:30,786 --> 01:00:33,787
Mila, pack some things.
Nothing bigger than this.
I can't go in the sewers.

720
01:00:33,887 --> 01:00:37,187
I told you I won't go
in the sewers.

721
01:00:40,186 --> 01:00:43,587
You can go.
Yes, you can.

722
01:00:45,787 --> 01:00:47,886
I won't go in the sewers.

723
01:00:58,687 --> 01:01:03,088
Move ! Over there !
Over there ! Move !

Deine Karte.!

729
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:19,987
Ich geh'nicht 'rauf

Deine Scheisskarte !

731
01:01:42,389 --> 01:01:44,688
Was soll denn die Scheisse 
Bist du denn verrueckt geworden?

732
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:47,288
Mit diesem Scheissgewehr
haettest du mich
erschiessen koennen.!

733
01:01:47,389 --> 01:01:49,388
Du hast so nah an mir
vorbeigeschossen.!

734
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:51,989
Was heisst hier Entschuldigung.
Du bist wohl verrueckt geworden.!

735
01:01:51,989 --> 01:01:55,288
Zurueckbleiben !
Zurueckbleiben !

736
01:01:59,588 --> 01:02:03,389
Nicht sprechen, nicht sprechen !
Einfach zu den Lastwagen gehen !

737
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:05,989
Weiterlaufen ! Weiterlaufen !
Nicht sprechen !

738
01:02:16,289 --> 01:02:18,089
Komm her, du Judensau.!

739
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:20,389
Bleib stehen, hab'ich gesagt.
Bleib stehen.!

01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:34,990
Chodzcie tu szybko.!

741
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:20,591
She's good as dead.
Leave her.

742
01:03:20,691 --> 01:03:24,291
Give me a moment.
Just let me bring her inside.

743
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:33,491
You can join her...
or join the line.

744
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:40,692
Women to the left.!
Wilhelm !
Rose !

745
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:43,592
Men to right.
Women to the left.

746
01:03:43,691 --> 01:03:46,391
Women
to the left.
Let me go !

747
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:54,792
Women to the left,
and men to the right.
Promise me, be safe.

748
01:03:56,692 --> 01:03:59,792
Your government
is in the wrong country.!

749
01:04:05,692 --> 01:04:07,992
Mama ! Mama !

750
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:58,094
Mila !

751
01:05:24,395 --> 01:05:27,995
Oh, God, Danka !

752
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:34,794
You have a Blauschein.
Blauschein doesn't
matter anymore.

753
01:05:34,794 --> 01:05:37,595
They are cleaning
out the ghetto.
There's not enough room for you.

754
01:05:37,595 --> 01:05:41,294
What are you talking about ?
We tried it before.
There's more than enough room.

755
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:44,394
- I changed my mind !
- Mama !

756
01:05:44,495 --> 01:05:48,896
Look at the space in there.
Now look at me.
You are just scared.

757
01:05:48,995 --> 01:05:51,295
I can fit the girl,
but not you.

758
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:53,794
- Mama, I'm coming out !
- Stay where you are.

759
01:05:53,895 --> 01:05:55,895
I'd rather you be here
than who knows where.

760
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,895
Mama.!

761
01:06:18,695 --> 01:06:20,396
Herr Kommandant.!

762
01:06:20,496 --> 01:06:22,696
Very good saluting.

763
01:06:22,696 --> 01:06:26,497
I respectfully report
I've been given orders to clear
the bundles from the road...

764
01:06:26,497 --> 01:06:29,696
so there will be no obstructions
to the thoroughfare.

765
01:06:29,696 --> 01:06:34,296
Finish and join the lines,
little Polish clicking soldier.

766
01:06:57,097 --> 01:06:58,997
Mrs. Dresner ?

767
01:06:59,096 --> 01:07:00,997
Yes.

768
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:03,497
Oh, you are a friend
of my son's.

769
01:07:03,596 --> 01:07:05,997
Don't worry, I'll go quietly.
I'll be no trouble.

770
01:07:06,098 --> 01:07:10,398
No, get under the stairs.
They'll be done searching soon.
You'll be safe there.

771
01:07:10,497 --> 01:07:13,797
Please hide ! Please !
...warmed by the sun.

772
01:07:13,897 --> 01:07:16,298
Hide under the stairs.

773
01:07:18,897 --> 01:07:21,698
I've searched the building.
There's no one here.

774
01:07:21,698 --> 01:07:24,698
Also, gehen wir
zum naechsten Block.
Einverstanden.

775
01:07:32,098 --> 01:07:34,597
Danka.! Ah.!
Mama !

776
01:07:39,998 --> 01:07:42,197
Hello, Adam.

777
01:07:42,298 --> 01:07:44,398
H-Hello, Danka.

778
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:54,398
Come with me.
I will put you
in the good line.

779
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:59,399
Do you know the saying, ''An hour
of life is still life'' ?

780
01:07:59,399 --> 01:08:03,699
You are not a boy anymore.
I'm saying a blessing for you.

781
01:08:10,499 --> 01:08:13,899

842
01:16:45,712 --> 01:16:49,013
Amon, you're such
a damned fuckin' child !

843
01:16:49,013 --> 01:16:51,212
Wakey, wakey.

844
01:17:01,013 --> 01:17:04,613
Make coffiee.
Make it yourself.

845
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,813
The SS will manage...

846
01:17:20,813 --> 01:17:23,914
certain industries itself
inside Plaszow--

847
01:17:23,914 --> 01:17:26,713
a metalworks,
brush factory,

848
01:17:26,713 --> 01:17:29,014
another for reprocessing
Jewish clothing...

849
01:17:29,014 --> 01:17:33,013
from the ghettos for use by
bombed-out families back home.

850
01:17:33,013 --> 01:17:36,214
But it's private industry
like yours that stands
to benefit most...

851
01:17:36,214 --> 01:17:38,615
by moving inside the wire of
Commandant Amon Goeth's camp--

852
01:17:38,615 --> 01:17:41,514
No, no, no. Sit, sit.
Julian, how are you ?

853
01:17:41,614 --> 01:17:43,014
How are you ?
Good to see you,
my friend.

854
01:17:43,114 --> 01:17:45,914
Oskar Schindler.
LeoJohn.

855
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:52,714
Franz, good to see you.
Hello, Oskar.
Glad you could join us.

856
01:17:52,814 --> 01:17:55,914
My pleasure. Julius.
How are you ?
You lost weight.

857
01:17:55,914 --> 01:18:00,014
Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down.

858
01:18:00,114 --> 01:18:02,814
How are you doing ?
Oskar Schindler.

859
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:07,915
We started without you.
Fine.
I miss anything good ?

860
01:18:08,015 --> 01:18:11,214
I was explaining
to Herr Bosch
and Herr Madritsch...

861
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:14,215
some of the benefits
of moving their
factories into Plaszow.

862
01:18:14,215 --> 01:18:17,215
I meant the food.

863
01:18:19,315 --> 01:18:23,415
Since your labor is housed
on-site, it's available
to you at all times.

864
01:18:23,516 --> 01:18:25,715
You can work them
all night if you want.

865
01:18:25,815 --> 01:18:30,315
Your factory policies, whatever
they've been in the past,
they'll continue to be.

866
01:18:30,315 --> 01:18:32,515
They'll be respected.

867
01:18:32,616 --> 01:18:36,916
I have to know, where
do you get a suit like that 
What is that  Is that silk ?

868
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:38,916
Of course.

869
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:43,216
Ja. It's-- It has
a nice sheen about it.

870
01:18:43,315 --> 01:18:45,216
Thank you.
Very nice.

871
01:18:45,316 --> 01:18:49,115
I'd say I'd get you one,
but the man who made it
is probably dead.

872
01:18:49,216 --> 01:18:51,716
I don't know.

873
01:18:51,816 --> 01:18:55,616
I go to work the other day.

874
01:18:55,616 --> 01:18:57,916
Nobody's there.

875
01:18:58,015 --> 01:19:01,416
Nobody tells me about this.
I have to fid out.
I have to go in.

876
01:19:01,516 --> 01:19:05,017
Everybody's gone.

877
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:08,016
No.

878
01:19:08,117 --> 01:19:10,216
No.

879
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:15,516
They're not gone.
They're here.

880
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:20,617
They're mine !
Every day that goes by,
I'm losing money.

881
01:19:20,617 --> 01:19:24,817
Every worker that is shot
costs me money. I have to
find somebody else.

882
01:19:24,917 --> 01:19:27,516
We are going to be making
so much money that none of this
is going to matter.

883
01:19:27,616 --> 01:19:29,117
It's bad business.

884
01:19:42,116 --> 01:19:44,117
Thank you.

885
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:46,717
Leave the bottle.

886
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:50,118
Take that.

887
01:19:50,217 --> 01:19:53,818
Lena... thank you.

888
01:20:03,118 --> 01:20:06,219
Scherner told me
something else about you.

889
01:20:08,518 --> 01:20:10,917
Yeah 
What's that ?

890
01:20:10,917 --> 01:20:15,619
That you know the meaning
of the word ''gratitude.''

891
01:20:15,718 --> 01:20:19,218
That it's not
some vague thing with you...

892
01:20:19,318 --> 01:20:22,518
like it is with others.

893
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:26,018
You want to stay
where you are.

894
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:29,219
You've got things
going on the side.

895
01:20:29,319 --> 01:20:31,419
Things are good.

896
01:20:31,518 --> 01:20:36,018
You don't want anybody
telling you what to do.

897
01:20:36,118 --> 01:20:40,619
I can understand all that,
you know. I-- I know you.

898
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:47,919
What you want...
is your own sub-camp.

899
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:56,819
Do you have any idea
what is involved 
The paperwork alone ?

900
01:20:56,919 --> 01:21:01,019
You've got to build the thing.
Getting those fucking permits
is enough to drive you crazy.

901
01:21:01,019 --> 01:21:05,220
Then the engineers show up,
they stand around, they argue
about drainage, foundations,

902
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:10,519
codes, exact specifications,
fences four kilometers long,
1 ,200 kilograms of barbed wire,

903
01:21:10,619 --> 01:21:13,920
6,000 kilograms of electrified
fences, ceramic insulators,

904
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,719
three cubic meters
of air space per prisoner.

905
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:19,819
I'm telling you,
you want to shoot somebody.
I've been through it. I know.

906
01:21:19,819 --> 01:21:23,620
Well, you know.
You've been through it.

907
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,620
You could make things
easier for me.

908
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:33,720
I'd be grateful.

909
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,719
Aus dem Weg da.!

910
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:53,721
Weitergehen.!
Weitergehen.!

911
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,420
Wlewo zwrot.!
Trzymac szereg.!

912
01:21:58,521 --> 01:22:01,421
Weitergehen.
Nach links.

913
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:11,021
Where's Stern ?

914
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:18,821
Goldberg and Chilowicz...
make sure I see my cut...

915
01:22:18,921 --> 01:22:22,421
from the, uh,
factory owners in this camp,

916
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:25,922
leaving you to take care
of my main account--

917
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:29,321
the Schindler account.

918
01:22:29,421 --> 01:22:33,421
He wants his independence.
I gave it to him.

919
01:22:33,522 --> 01:22:36,422
But independence
costs money.

920
01:22:36,522 --> 01:22:38,921
This you
understand ?

921
01:22:43,821 --> 01:22:45,722
Look at me.

922
01:22:56,422 --> 01:23:00,522
Don't forget who
you are working for now.

923
01:23:08,022 --> 01:23:10,023
####

924
01:23:10,122 --> 01:23:13,322
Jawohl.!
Make sure he kisses

925
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:16,823
Ja. Now, girls,
everyone.

926
01:23:19,722 --> 01:23:22,323
We need more wine.
More wine !

927
01:23:22,422 --> 01:23:26,223
Stand in my place.
Don't let him leave.

928
01:23:42,223 --> 01:23:45,623
## Was passiert denn
in einem Leben ##
Prost.! Prost.!

929
01:23:47,623 --> 01:23:50,324
Thank you,
Herr Direktor.

930
01:23:50,424 --> 01:23:52,823
Prost,
Herr Direktor !

931
01:23:56,923 --> 01:24:00,425
What are you
doing 
What ?

932
01:24:00,524 --> 01:24:04,924
Makes them think we have lice.
Helps them keep their distance.

933
01:24:05,024 --> 01:24:07,523
Do you have lice 
Do you have your notebook ?

934
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:11,225
The calendar on my desk has
the birthdays of our SS friends'
wives and children.

935
01:24:11,324 --> 01:24:13,925
Don't forget
to send something.

936
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:17,425
Record payoffs
to the Main Administration
and Economics Office, the Arm--

937
01:24:17,524 --> 01:24:21,424
Slower, Stern, slower.
The Armaments Board,
Governor General's Division...

938
01:24:21,525 --> 01:24:24,425
of the Interior
and Chief of Police as ''fees,''

939
01:24:24,525 --> 01:24:26,524
and make them
on the first of each month,

940
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:28,924
as opposed to individual payoffs
to our SS contacts.

941
01:24:29,025 --> 01:24:34,424
The list is in the lower drawer
of my desk, which you--
''First of month--''

942
01:24:34,525 --> 01:24:37,425
list,
lower drawer of my desk,
which you handle...

943
01:24:37,524 --> 01:24:41,725
as cash contributions
to legitimate charities
sent to each official's office.

944
01:24:41,824 --> 01:24:44,925
Dealings with
our black market contacts,
listed as suppliers...

945
01:24:44,925 --> 01:24:48,626
in the legitimate ledger,
are more complicated.
Forget it.

946
01:24:48,725 --> 01:24:52,625
What do you mean, forget it ?
You can't forget it !
It gives me a headache !

947
01:24:59,426 --> 01:25:02,826
I couldn't get you
out of here.
I'll be all right.

948
01:25:02,826 --> 01:25:07,026
Anyway, I'm here
almost every week.
Wednesdays, usually.

949
01:25:07,026 --> 01:25:10,526
I'll look in on you,
see how you're doing.

950
01:25:12,626 --> 01:25:16,326
Here, put these
in your pocket.

951
01:25:16,326 --> 01:25:18,427
Come on.

952
01:25:21,225 --> 01:25:24,627
Herr Direktor,
don't let things fall apart.

953
01:25:24,726 --> 01:25:26,926
I've worked too hard.

954
01:25:35,227 --> 01:25:39,826
Thanks for--
Good luck.

955
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:43,827
## 

956
01:26:01,627 --> 01:26:04,027
Achtung, Muetzen ab.!

957
01:26:13,927 --> 01:26:16,427
- Work !
- An die Arbeit.!

958
01:26:30,129 --> 01:26:31,628
What are you making ?

959
01:26:31,928 --> 01:26:34,428
Hinges, sir.

960
01:26:37,328 --> 01:26:40,929
Ja, I've got some workers
coming in tomorrow.
Where are they from again ?

961
01:26:41,028 --> 01:26:43,428
Yugoslavia,
Herr Kommandant.

962
01:26:43,428 --> 01:26:45,728
I've got to make room.

963
01:26:48,129 --> 01:26:51,428
Make me a hinge.
Yes, sir.

964
01:27:22,829 --> 01:27:26,030
Keep going,
you're doing well.

965
01:27:26,129 --> 01:27:28,229
Says he's
doing well.

966
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:37,629
Oh, that's very good.

967
01:27:37,629 --> 01:27:41,630
But I'm a bit confused,
and perhaps you can help me.

968
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:45,130
What I don't understand
is that you've been working...

969
01:27:45,231 --> 01:27:48,930
since I think, what,
about six this morning ?

970
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:54,930
Yet such a small pile
of hinges.

971
01:28:24,031 --> 01:28:26,931
Oh, Christ.
May I try that, sir ?

972
01:28:26,931 --> 01:28:29,231
Check the angle-lever.
Maybe it's bent.

973
01:28:29,231 --> 01:28:32,731
No, no.
You wouldn't hear a click
if it was the angle-lever.

974
01:28:32,831 --> 01:28:35,232
Maybe it's the pin.
Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.
Ja, come on.

975
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:38,332
What did I just say ?
Here.

976
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:43,331
Herr Kommandant,

977
01:28:43,432 --> 01:28:47,932
I beg to report
that my heap ofhinges
was so unsatisfactory...

978
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:52,331
because the machines
were being recalibrated
this morning.

979
01:28:52,432 --> 01:28:57,332
I w-was put on
to shoveling coal.

980
01:29:21,132 --> 01:29:23,233
Strange, huh ?

981
01:29:23,332 --> 01:29:25,232
Yeah.

982
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:33,233
Thank you, Muek.

983
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:37,232
Ah, Lisiek.
Don't touch the leather,
it's just been oiled.

984
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:39,033
Rottenfuehrer.
Oh, for me ?

985
01:29:39,033 --> 01:29:42,733
Oh, thank you very much,
Herr Direktor. Thank you.
 Herr Direktor !

986
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:45,333
Herr Direktor.!

987
01:29:47,934 --> 01:29:50,533
Herr Direktor.!

988
01:29:51,733 --> 01:29:53,733
He was making
hinges slowly.

989
01:29:53,832 --> 01:29:58,734
So the man can turn out a hinge
in less than a minute.
Why the long story  Hmm ?

990
01:30:27,834 --> 01:30:30,635
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.

991
01:30:33,834 --> 01:30:37,835
Nobody knows
who stole the chicken, hmm ?
Tell him about the chicken.

992
01:30:37,835 --> 01:30:42,635
A man walks around
with a chicken and
nobody notices this.

993
01:30:42,734 --> 01:30:45,235
Save yourselves.

994
01:30:45,335 --> 01:30:47,734
Tell him
about the chicken.

995
01:31:03,435 --> 01:31:05,535
Still nobody knows.

996
01:31:17,235 --> 01:31:21,036
It was you.
You committed this crime.

997
01:31:21,036 --> 01:31:23,435
No, sir.
But you know who, though.

998
01:31:23,535 --> 01:31:25,836
Yes.
Who ?

999
01:31:25,936 --> 01:31:28,936
Him !

1000
01:31:32,435 --> 01:31:36,337
He's very gifted.
Yeah, sure.
Bring him over.

1001
01:31:39,135 --> 01:31:43,036
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

1002
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:52,036
Thank you again,
Herr Direktor.
You're welcome again.

1003
01:31:52,036 --> 01:31:55,836
It's an honor to work
for such a great company.
It's great to have you.

1004
01:31:55,937 --> 01:32:00,137
I promise to learn everything
about enamelware production.
That's great.

1005
01:32:12,637 --> 01:32:16,837
Hello ?
Miss Elsa Krause is here.
I only need five minutes.

1006
01:32:16,837 --> 01:32:19,637
She wants to speak
to the Herr Direktor.

1007
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:41,338
Yes.

1008
01:32:45,537 --> 01:32:47,838
He won't see you.

1009
01:33:18,439 --> 01:33:20,539
Please, sit down.

1010
01:33:23,739 --> 01:33:26,639
Pernod 
Cognac ?
Uh, no.

1011
01:33:27,839 --> 01:33:30,739
So, what
can I do for you ?

1012
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:37,840
They say that no one
dies here.

1013
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,539
They say your factory
is a haven.

1014
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:45,640
They say you are good.

1015
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,839
Who says that ?

1016
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:53,039
Everyone.

1017
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:02,340
My name is Regina Perlman,
not Elsa Krause.

1018
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:05,640
I've been living in Krakow
on false papers since
the ghetto massacre.

1019
01:34:05,739 --> 01:34:07,241
My parents are in Plaszow.

1020
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:11,840
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.

1021
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:15,740
They are older people.
They are killing older people
now in Plaszow.

1022
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:19,741
They bury them
up in the forest. Look...

1023
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,741
I don't have any money.

1024
01:34:22,841 --> 01:34:25,741
I, I borrowed
these clothes.

1025
01:34:28,441 --> 01:34:30,541
I'm begging you.

1026
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:34,540
Please, please
bring them here.

1027
01:34:34,641 --> 01:34:37,141
I don't do that.

1028
01:34:37,141 --> 01:34:41,141
You've been misled.

1029
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:44,442
whether or not a worker
has certain skills.

1030
01:34:44,442 --> 01:34:47,341
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

1031
01:34:47,441 --> 01:34:51,341
Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me !

1032
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:55,741
Cry, and I will
have you arrested.
I swear to God !

1033
01:35:05,442 --> 01:35:08,141
People die.
It's a fact of life.

1034
01:35:08,241 --> 01:35:12,042
He wants to kill everybody 
Great ! What am I supposed
to do about it ?

1035
01:35:12,142 --> 01:35:14,842
Bring everybody over 
Is that what you think ?

1036
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:17,842
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all !

1037
01:35:17,842 --> 01:35:21,542
His place is a haven,
didn't you know ?
It's not a factory.

1038
01:35:21,642 --> 01:35:23,941
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

1039
01:35:23,941 --> 01:35:26,841
It's a haven for rabbis
and orphans...

1040
01:35:26,942 --> 01:35:30,242
and people with
no skills whatsoever !

1041
01:35:31,543 --> 01:35:35,843
You think I don't know
what you're doing ?

1042
01:35:35,843 --> 01:35:39,442
You're so quiet
all the time.
I know, I know !

1043
01:35:39,542 --> 01:35:42,442
Are you losing money ?
That's not the point !

1044
01:35:42,542 --> 01:35:46,443
What other point is--
It's dangerous !
It's dangerous to me !

1045
01:35:48,874 --> 01:35:52,473
You have to understand.
Goeth is under enormous
pressure.

1046
01:35:52,573 --> 01:35:55,773
You have to think of it
in his situation.

1047
01:35:55,873 --> 01:35:58,773
He's got this
whole place to run.

1048
01:35:58,874 --> 01:36:01,774
He's responsible
for everything here,
all these people.

1049
01:36:01,873 --> 01:36:04,874
He's got a lot of things
to worry about.

1050
01:36:04,874 --> 01:36:09,074
And he's got the war
which brings out
the worst in people.

1051
01:36:09,174 --> 01:36:12,574
Never the good,
always the bad.
Always the bad.

1052
01:36:14,874 --> 01:36:19,475
But in normal circumstances
he wouldn't be like this.
He'd be all right.

1053
01:36:19,574 --> 01:36:23,075
There'd just be the good
aspects of him which--

1054
01:36:23,075 --> 01:36:26,774
He's a wonderful crook.

1055
01:36:26,874 --> 01:36:31,274
A man who loves good food,
good wine, the ladies,
making money--

1056
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:33,675
Killing.

1057
01:36:33,675 --> 01:36:36,474
He can't enjoy it.

1058
01:36:36,575 --> 01:36:39,674
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped...

1059
01:36:39,775 --> 01:36:42,575
from a work detail
outside the wire.

1060
01:36:42,575 --> 01:36:46,575
Goeth lined up everybody
from the missing man's barracks.

1061
01:36:46,675 --> 01:36:50,775
He shot the man
to the left of Bejski,
the man to the right ofhim.

1062
01:36:50,775 --> 01:36:54,575
He walked down the line
shooting every other man
with the pistol.

1063
01:36:59,675 --> 01:37:02,176
Twenty-five.

1064
01:37:06,076 --> 01:37:09,775
What do you want me
to do about it ?
Nothing, nothing.

1065
01:37:09,876 --> 01:37:12,176
We're just talking.

1066
01:37:23,876 --> 01:37:25,776
''Perlman.''

1067
01:37:27,476 --> 01:37:29,576
Perlman !

1068
01:37:29,576 --> 01:37:32,375
Husband and wife.

1069
01:37:32,476 --> 01:37:36,277
Jakob and Chana Perlman !

1070
01:37:49,477 --> 01:37:52,776
Have Goldberg
bring them over.

1071
01:37:54,677 --> 01:37:58,076
Muetzen ab !

1072
01:37:58,177 --> 01:38:00,277
Appell abtreten !

1073
01:38:36,078 --> 01:38:40,078
## 

1074
01:38:48,078 --> 01:38:52,178
I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, Lisiek.

1075
01:38:52,278 --> 01:38:56,179
Herr Direktor,
I was just helping Lisiek
to find something...

1076
01:38:56,278 --> 01:38:59,179
to clean the stains
from the Herr Kommandant's
bathtub.

1077
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:02,178
Go, please.
Pardon me,
Herr Direktor.

1078
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:08,779
You don't have to report
to me, Helen.

1079
01:39:08,779 --> 01:39:12,079
You know who I am 
Hmm ?

1080
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:23,479
I'm Schindler.

1081
01:39:23,579 --> 01:39:26,679
Of course.
I-I have heard and...

1082
01:39:26,779 --> 01:39:29,780
you have
been here before.

1083
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:34,979
Here, why don't you
keep this someplace ?

1084
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:38,579
Go on, take it.
I get extra food here.

1085
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:43,379
Well, if you don't
want to eat it, trade it.
Or give it to Lisiek.

1086
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:48,480
Why not
build yourself up ?

1087
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:57,079
My first day here,
he beat me...

1088
01:39:57,180 --> 01:40:01,080
because I threw out
the bones from dinner.

1089
01:40:04,279 --> 01:40:08,780
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he--

1090
01:40:08,881 --> 01:40:11,580
he asked me
where they were.

1091
01:40:14,081 --> 01:40:18,680
For his dogs,
you understand.

1092
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:24,981
I said to him, I--
I don't know how I say this.

1093
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:28,582
I never could say it now--
I said to him,

1094
01:40:28,681 --> 01:40:31,081
''Why are you beating me ?''

1095
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,982
He said, ''The reason
I beat you now...

1096
01:40:38,081 --> 01:40:41,981
is because you ask
why I beat you.''

1097
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,782
I know your
sufferings, Helen.

1098
01:40:49,281 --> 01:40:51,682
It doesn't matter.

1099
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:56,382
I have accepted them.

1100
01:40:56,382 --> 01:40:58,681
Accepted them ?

1101
01:41:00,482 --> 01:41:02,682
One day
he will shoot me.

1102
01:41:02,781 --> 01:41:05,182
No, no, no, no,
he won't shoot you.

1103
01:41:05,282 --> 01:41:08,981
I know.
I see things.

1104
01:41:09,081 --> 01:41:12,483
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I,

1105
01:41:12,582 --> 01:41:16,583
and we saw the Herr Kommandant
come out of the front door...

1106
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:21,482
and down the steps by the patio
right there below us and--

1107
01:41:21,582 --> 01:41:26,482
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he...

1108
01:41:26,582 --> 01:41:29,482
shot a woman
who was passing by.

1109
01:41:30,982 --> 01:41:34,283
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1110
01:41:34,383 --> 01:41:37,982
Just-- Just a woman
on her way somewhere,
you know.

1111
01:41:38,082 --> 01:41:41,983
She was no fatter
or thinner...

1112
01:41:42,083 --> 01:41:44,482
or slower or faster
than anyone else,

1113
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:48,283
and I couldn't guess
what had she done.

1114
01:41:53,083 --> 01:41:56,783
The more you see
of the Herr Kommandant,

1115
01:41:56,783 --> 01:42:01,783
the more you see
there is no set rules
that you can live by.

1116
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:06,684
You can't say to yourself,
''If I follow these rules,
I will be safe.''

1117
01:42:10,284 --> 01:42:14,583
He won't shoot you
because he enjoys you
too much.

1118
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:18,684
He enjoys you so much
he won't even let you
wear the star.

1119
01:42:18,783 --> 01:42:21,184
He doesn't want
anyone else to know...

1120
01:42:21,284 --> 01:42:23,683
it's a Jew
he's enjoying.

1121
01:42:27,084 --> 01:42:30,084
He shot the woman
from the steps...

1122
01:42:30,084 --> 01:42:33,884
because she meant
nothing to him.

1123
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:36,383
She was
one of a series,

1124
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:39,184
neither offending
or pleasing him.

1125
01:42:43,084 --> 01:42:45,484
But you, Helen.

1126
01:42:49,984 --> 01:42:54,485
It's all right.
It's not that kind
of a kiss.

1127
01:42:58,785 --> 01:43:01,284
Thank you.

1128
01:43:01,284 --> 01:43:03,385
Shh.

1129
01:43:06,584 --> 01:43:08,485
Here.

1130
01:43:14,685 --> 01:43:17,085
Right. The wine.

1131
01:43:24,186 --> 01:43:27,185
Wonderful party, Amon.
Thank you.

1132
01:43:35,685 --> 01:43:38,586
Why do you drink
that motor oil ?

1133
01:43:38,686 --> 01:43:41,786
Hmm ? I send you
good stuff all the time.

1134
01:43:41,786 --> 01:43:45,787
Your liver's
going to explode
like a hand grenade.

1135
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:48,786
The more I look at you--

1136
01:43:48,886 --> 01:43:51,186
I watch you.

1137
01:43:52,787 --> 01:43:54,886
You're never drunk.

1138
01:43:54,987 --> 01:43:58,987
Oh, that's--

1139
01:43:59,087 --> 01:44:02,187
that's real control.

1140
01:44:02,187 --> 01:44:04,387
Control is power.

1141
01:44:05,386 --> 01:44:07,687
That's power.

1142
01:44:11,487 --> 01:44:15,487
Is that why they fear us ?

1143
01:44:15,487 --> 01:44:20,187
We have the fucking
power to kill, that's
why they fear us.

1144
01:44:20,286 --> 01:44:24,188
They fear us because
we have the power
to kill arbitrarily.

1145
01:44:24,287 --> 01:44:26,487
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

1146
01:44:26,587 --> 01:44:29,187
We have him killed,
and feel good about it.

1147
01:44:29,288 --> 01:44:32,287
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

1148
01:44:34,587 --> 01:44:37,688
That's not power,
though.

1149
01:44:37,787 --> 01:44:41,988
That's justice.
It's different than power.

1150
01:44:44,688 --> 01:44:49,788
Power is when we have every
justification to kill...

1151
01:44:49,888 --> 01:44:52,488
and we don't.

1152
01:44:52,588 --> 01:44:54,787
You think that's power ?

1153
01:44:57,488 --> 01:45:00,688
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something,

1154
01:45:00,788 --> 01:45:02,389
he's brought in
before the emperor,

1155
01:45:02,488 --> 01:45:06,588
he throws himself
down on the ground,
he begs for mercy.

1156
01:45:06,689 --> 01:45:10,188
He knows
he's going to die.

1157
01:45:12,088 --> 01:45:15,588
And the emperor...
pardons him.

1158
01:45:16,889 --> 01:45:20,189
This worthless man.
He lets him go.

1159
01:45:23,289 --> 01:45:25,788
I think you are drunk.

1160
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:30,489
That's power, Amon.

1161
01:45:30,589 --> 01:45:33,988
That... is power.

1162
01:45:41,689 --> 01:45:44,489
Amon the Good.

1163
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:50,689
I pardon you.

1164
01:45:56,289 --> 01:45:58,790
What do they want ?

1165
01:45:58,889 --> 01:46:02,289
[ Stern ] I don't know,
but they're in my office now
reviewing our books.

1166
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:05,589
As my accountant, tell me,
should I be alarmed...

1167
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:08,590
that the auditors
are reviewing my books ?
Well--

1168
01:46:08,689 --> 01:46:11,490
Or have you done
your job properly ?
You needn't be alarmed.

1169
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:13,589
I needn't
be alarmed.

1170
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:18,790
I'm sorry, sir.

1171
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:20,990
Do you know how much
this saddle is worth ?

1172
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:23,691
Do you know how much
it costs ?

1173
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:32,091
All right.

1174
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:34,190
All right.

1175
01:46:37,591 --> 01:46:40,690
Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around ?

1176
01:46:49,891 --> 01:46:53,291
Barracken eins, elf,

1177
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:55,991
fuenfzehn

01:46:56,092 --> 01:46:58,792
am Appellplatz melden.

1179
01:47:26,491 --> 01:47:29,392
She was smoking
on the job.

1180
01:47:33,092 --> 01:47:36,192
Tell her
not to do it again.

1181
01:47:51,792 --> 01:47:54,693
I have to report, sir,

1182
01:47:54,792 --> 01:47:58,692
I've been unable to remove
the stains from your bathtub.

1183
01:48:02,893 --> 01:48:06,693
What are you using,
Lisiek ?
Soap, Commandant.

1184
01:48:09,093 --> 01:48:11,493
Soap  Not lye ?

1185
01:48:20,693 --> 01:48:24,693
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

1186
01:48:46,794 --> 01:48:48,993
I pardon you.

1187
01:50:40,797 --> 01:50:44,397
Although I am not a rabbi,
in these circumstances...

1188
01:50:44,496 --> 01:50:47,197
I pray to the Almighty
that you will forgive me...

1189
01:50:47,297 --> 01:50:50,397
if I intone the blessings.

1190
01:50:50,497 --> 01:50:53,297

1200
01:51:42,999 --> 01:51:45,398
So...

1201
01:51:45,398 --> 01:51:49,499
this is where you come
to hide from me.

1202
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:52,899
I came to tell you...

1203
01:51:52,999 --> 01:51:56,999
that you, um, you really are
a wonderful cook...

1204
01:51:56,999 --> 01:52:00,100
and a well-trained servant.

1205
01:52:00,199 --> 01:52:04,598
I mean it.
If you need a reference
after the war,

1206
01:52:04,699 --> 01:52:09,500
I'd be-- I'd be happy
to give you one.

1207
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:12,000
It must get lonely
down here...

1208
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:16,500
when you're listening
to everyone upstairs
having such a good time.

1209
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:25,999
Does it ?

1210
01:52:27,701 --> 01:52:29,699
You can answer.

1211
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:36,500
But what's the right answer ?
That's what you're thinking.

1212
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:39,600
What does he want to hear ?

1213
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:48,901
The truth, Helen,
is always the right answer.

1214
01:52:51,601 --> 01:52:54,200
Y-Yes, you're right.

1215
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:57,701
Sometimes
we're both lonely.

1216
01:52:57,801 --> 01:53:00,800
Yes. I--

1217
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,400
I mean--

1218
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:14,701
I would like so much to...

1219
01:53:14,801 --> 01:53:18,701
reach out and touch you
in your loneliness.

1220
01:53:18,802 --> 01:53:22,202
Wh-What would that be like,
I wonder ? I mean...

1221
01:53:22,301 --> 01:53:26,002
what would be wrong with that ?

1222
01:53:26,102 --> 01:53:30,402
I realize that you're not
a-a person in the--

1223
01:53:30,501 --> 01:53:33,401
the strictest sense
of the word, but--

1224
01:53:33,401 --> 01:53:36,902
No, maybe you're right
about that too, you know.

1225
01:53:36,902 --> 01:53:41,902
Maybe what's--
what's wrong isn't--

1226
01:53:41,902 --> 01:53:44,502
It's not us.

1227
01:53:44,601 --> 01:53:47,002
It's no--
It's this.

1228
01:53:49,501 --> 01:53:53,801
I mean, when they
compare you to--

1229
01:53:53,801 --> 01:53:57,103
to, uh, vermin
and to rodents and to lice...

1230
01:53:59,203 --> 01:54:02,201
I just, uh--

1231
01:54:05,703 --> 01:54:08,603
N-No, you-you make
a good point.

1232
01:54:08,702 --> 01:54:11,102
You make
a very good point.

1233
01:54:19,502 --> 01:54:21,902
Is this the face
of a rat ?

1234
01:54:25,103 --> 01:54:27,303
Are these the eyes
of a rat ?

1235
01:54:27,403 --> 01:54:30,302
# Milosc... #

1236
01:54:30,404 --> 01:54:33,003
Hath not a Jew eyes ?

1237
01:54:33,003 --> 01:54:38,903
# Ci wszystko wybaczy #

1238
01:54:38,903 --> 01:54:45,704
# Bo milosc moj mily #

1239
01:54:48,903 --> 01:54:52,603
I feel for you, Helen.

1240
01:54:55,404 --> 01:55:00,304
## Toja ####

1241
01:55:09,404 --> 01:55:12,204
No, I don't think so.

1242
01:55:14,204 --> 01:55:17,104
You're a Jewish bitch.

1243
01:55:18,704 --> 01:55:22,804
You nearly talked me into it,
Helen, didn't you ?

1244
01:55:28,104 --> 01:55:30,704
Bravo.

1245
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:49,905
Hoch .! Hoch .! Hoch .!

1246
01:55:50,006 --> 01:55:52,505
####

1247
01:55:52,604 --> 01:55:56,405
- Jawohl.!
- Hoch.! Hoch.!

1248
01:55:56,505 --> 01:55:59,705
Hoch !

1249
01:56:05,005 --> 01:56:07,606
On behalf of the--
of the workers, sir,

1250
01:56:07,705 --> 01:56:10,906
I, I wish for you
a happy birthday.

1251
01:56:11,005 --> 01:56:13,005
Happy birthday.

1252
01:56:13,106 --> 01:56:15,405
Well, thank
the staff, please.

1253
01:56:15,506 --> 01:56:18,306
Thank you very much
for the lovely cake.

1254
01:56:36,106 --> 01:56:40,907
Thank you very much.
Tell them thank you from me.

1255
01:56:48,808 --> 01:56:52,607
## To ostatnia niedziela ##

1256
01:56:52,707 --> 01:56:56,107
##Dzisiaj sie rozstaniemy ##

1257
01:56:56,208 --> 01:57:01,107
The trains arrived
and the people were
driven out with clubs.

1258
01:57:01,107 --> 01:57:05,608
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

1259
01:57:05,707 --> 01:57:09,807
One was marked ''Cloak Room,''
and the other ''Valuables.''

1260
01:57:09,908 --> 01:57:12,308
And there they
were made to undress.

1261
01:57:12,407 --> 01:57:16,908
AJewish boy handed them
pieces of string to tie
their shoes together.

1262
01:57:17,008 --> 01:57:19,707
They shaved their hair.

1263
01:57:19,807 --> 01:57:24,707
They told them it was needed
to make something special
for U-boat crews.

1264
01:57:24,808 --> 01:57:29,007
And then they were herded
down a big corridor...

1265
01:57:29,108 --> 01:57:33,208
to bunkers with
Stars of David on the doors,

1266
01:57:33,307 --> 01:57:37,208
and signs that said
''Bath and Inhalation Room.''

1267
01:57:37,308 --> 01:57:39,508
SS gave them soap.

1268
01:57:39,607 --> 01:57:44,708
They told them to
breathe all the time because
it's good for disinfecting.

1269
01:57:44,808 --> 01:57:47,609
And then they gassed them.

1270
01:57:48,908 --> 01:57:51,509
Mila, why soaps ?

1271
01:57:51,608 --> 01:57:54,208
So that they would agree
to go in, I think.

1272
01:57:54,208 --> 01:57:58,008
Come on, Mila, stop it.
Your bedtime stories
are scaring everyone.

1273
01:57:58,008 --> 01:58:00,508
I just don't believe it.
Ja. You know
it's ridiculous.

1274
01:58:00,609 --> 01:58:02,608
I don't believe it
either.
I cannot believe it.

1275
01:58:02,710 --> 01:58:05,309
I didn't say I believed it.
I said I heard it.

1276
01:58:05,409 --> 01:58:08,709
From who ?
From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.

1277
01:58:08,709 --> 01:58:11,310
You know,
if they were there,

1278
01:58:11,409 --> 01:58:13,709
they would
have been gassed.

1279
01:58:13,709 --> 01:58:17,208
Yes.
It doesn't
make any sense.

1280
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:19,310
We're their work force.

1281
01:58:19,409 --> 01:58:23,209
What sense does it make
to kill your own work force ?

1282
01:58:23,309 --> 01:58:28,209
To go to all this trouble
of assembling a work force
only to--

1283
01:58:28,309 --> 01:58:31,609
No, it can't be true.

1284
01:58:31,609 --> 01:58:34,610
We are very, very
important for them.

1285
01:58:34,610 --> 01:58:38,009
Ja, we do now.
Good night.

1286
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:41,110
Good night.
Good night.
Sweet dreams.

1287
01:58:49,589 --> 01:58:52,188
Attention, attention.

1288
01:58:52,288 --> 01:58:54,689
Everyone who is alive...

1289
01:58:54,789 --> 01:58:58,288
is to come
to the Appellplatz.

1290
01:58:58,389 --> 01:59:02,890
Attention, attention.
Come, we have to go
to the Appellplatz.

1291
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:04,090
Everyone who is alive...
The listmakers are here.

1292
01:59:04,189 --> 01:59:07,190
is to come to the Appellplatz.
There is going
to be a selection.

1293
01:59:07,289 --> 01:59:11,889
Attention, attention.
Everyone who is alive...

1294
01:59:11,989 --> 01:59:15,889
is to come
to the Appellplatz.

1295
01:59:29,689 --> 01:59:31,690
Meine Herren.

1296
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:33,690
Raz.!
Dwa.!

1297

01:59:35,990 --> 01:59:38,190
...die Hunderttausend
Ungarn kommen...

1299
01:59:40,289 --> 01:59:44,190
Alle in einer
Einzelreihe aufstellen !

1300
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:48,390
You could afford
to lose some weight, Amon.

1301
01:59:48,490 --> 01:59:51,091
And you've got to
cut down on the cognac.

1302
01:59:51,091 --> 01:59:54,091
Morning.
What's going on ?

1303
01:59:54,091 --> 01:59:57,091
It's another
semiannual physical.

1304
01:59:58,989 --> 02:00:03,790
There.
Oh, I've, um, got another
shipment coming in of, uh--

1305
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:05,991
What are they this time ?

1306
02:00:06,090 --> 02:00:07,991
Hungarians.
Oh, ja, Hungarians.

1307
02:00:07,991 --> 02:00:11,691
We've got to separate
the sick from the healthy
to make room.

1308
02:00:15,791 --> 02:00:21,291

We've got to go out there.

02:01:07,092 --> 02:01:09,791
Don't go.

1317
02:01:09,791 --> 02:01:11,893
Look alive, Rebeka.

1318

Wait, go away.
She can work.

1336
02:02:47,095 --> 02:02:50,896
Come here. Look,
separate the sick
from the healthy.

Those who can work

She can work.

You can work,

Olek ! Olek !

1366
02:05:28,499 --> 02:05:31,400
Olek 
Danka ?

1367
02:05:31,499 --> 02:05:33,399
Danka 
Olek ?

1368
02:05:33,499 --> 02:05:36,500
Ab in die Barracke.!
In die Barracke mit euch.!

1369
02:05:36,599 --> 02:05:40,699
I didn't see him !
They're hiding.
I'm telling you, they're hiding.

1370
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:44,299
I know Danka.
She took them to a good place.
She took all of them together.

1371
02:05:44,299 --> 02:05:47,100
Zurueck in die Barracken !

1372
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:50,600
##...mein Paradies ##

1373
02:05:50,699 --> 02:06:00,500
##Mamatschi solche
Pferde wollte ich nicht ##

1374
02:06:01,799 --> 02:06:04,400
####

1375
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:12,300
Find your own hiding place.
There's no room for you here.
Go away, quick !

1376
02:06:12,401 --> 02:06:16,101
####

1377
02:06:35,801 --> 02:06:38,802
Get out. This is our place.
Get out !

1378
02:07:02,602 --> 02:07:05,903
Oskar !
Amon. Gentlemen.

1379
02:07:06,002 --> 02:07:09,302
Why didn't you call me ?
I tried to call you.
Here, Hujar, move.

1380
02:07:09,402 --> 02:07:12,202
Quite a picnic, huh ?
Madritsch.
Oskar.

1381
02:07:12,302 --> 02:07:15,103
I'm running a little late.
This is taking longer
than I thought.

1382
02:07:15,202 --> 02:07:18,403
A drink ?
Something cold.
Bowle.

1383
02:07:18,502 --> 02:07:20,702
The Bowle.

1384
02:07:22,402 --> 02:07:25,603
Oh, another
beautiful day.

1385
02:07:28,402 --> 02:07:30,703
Cisza.! Spokoj.!

1386
02:07:38,702 --> 02:07:41,002
Die Beladung der Transportwagen
ist beendet.

1387
02:07:41,103 --> 02:07:43,603
Wir sind abfahrbereit.

1388
02:07:43,703 --> 02:07:46,202
Wody.!
Wody.!

1389
02:07:46,202 --> 02:07:49,302
Wasser... wasser.

1390
02:07:55,603 --> 02:07:59,602
Wohlsein.
Oh, thank you.

1391
02:08:05,404 --> 02:08:10,704
What do you say we get your
fire hoses out here and hose
down the cars ? Thank you.

1392
02:08:12,803 --> 02:08:15,203
Indulge me.

1393
02:08:16,704 --> 02:08:18,904
Hujar.
Yes, sir.

1394
02:08:19,004 --> 02:08:22,603
- Go bring the fire hoses.
- Where's the fire ?

1395
02:08:26,204 --> 02:08:29,904
In the windows.
That's it, that's it.

1396
02:08:30,004 --> 02:08:34,103
On the roof.
That's it, good, good.
In the window, in the window.

1397
02:08:37,004 --> 02:08:40,904
Come on. Come on.

1398
02:08:40,904 --> 02:08:42,905
That's it, more, more.

1399
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:51,005
That's it, that's it.
More, more.

1400
02:08:51,105 --> 02:08:54,704
This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

1401
02:08:54,704 --> 02:08:58,604
You shouldn't do that.
That's cruel.!

1402
02:08:58,705 --> 02:09:02,204
Come on, try and
reach the far end.
Look out--

1403
02:09:02,306 --> 02:09:05,304
Water.! More water.!

1404
02:09:07,606 --> 02:09:11,505
I've got some 200-meter
hoses back at Emalia.

1405
02:09:11,604 --> 02:09:13,504
I have 20 meters
at home in my garden.

1406
02:09:13,605 --> 02:09:15,806
We can reach
the cars at the end.

1407
02:09:15,806 --> 02:09:18,305
What  What ?

1408
02:09:18,406 --> 02:09:22,706
Huh ?

1409
02:09:22,805 --> 02:09:25,105
Hujar.
Yeah, sure.

1410
02:09:43,705 --> 02:09:46,306
Don't forget
the roof.

1411
02:09:46,406 --> 02:09:49,206
On the roof
on the other side.

1412
02:09:49,307 --> 02:09:53,606
Water.!

1413
02:09:56,006 --> 02:09:58,507
Scharfuehrer,
every time the train stops,

1414
02:09:58,507 --> 02:10:01,006
you open the doors,
you give them water, ja ?

1415
02:10:01,006 --> 02:10:04,007
Jawohl.
Ja. This car !
This car !

1416
02:10:28,507 --> 02:10:31,808
I'm not saying you'll
regret it, but you might.

1417
02:10:31,907 --> 02:10:36,707
You should be
aware of that.
We will have to risk regret.

1418
02:10:36,806 --> 02:10:40,607
All right, sure.
It's a nice day. I'll go
for a drive with you.

1419
02:11:15,608 --> 02:11:18,008
What about you ?

1420
02:11:18,109 --> 02:11:22,308
I violated the
''Race and Resettlement Act.''

1421
02:11:22,409 --> 02:11:26,408
Though I doubt
anyone can point out
the actual provision to me.

1422
02:11:26,509 --> 02:11:29,808
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1423
02:11:33,509 --> 02:11:36,409
Did your prick fall off?

1424
02:11:55,009 --> 02:11:58,110
He likes women.

1425
02:11:59,109 --> 02:12:02,310
He likes
good-looking women.

1426
02:12:03,909 --> 02:12:08,209
He sees a beautiful woman,
he doesn't think.

1427
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:11,109
I mean,

1428
02:12:11,210 --> 02:12:13,910
he has so many women.

1429
02:12:13,910 --> 02:12:16,110
And they love him.

1430
02:12:16,110 --> 02:12:19,210
Ja, they love him.
I mean, he is married,
ja, but he's--

1431
02:12:19,210 --> 02:12:24,411
All right, it's not--
She was Jewish.
He shouldn't have done it.

1432
02:12:24,510 --> 02:12:28,210
But, you didn't see this girl.

1433
02:12:28,311 --> 02:12:31,710
I saw this girl.
This girl was, woof--

1434
02:12:31,811 --> 02:12:34,011
She was very good-looking.

1435
02:12:37,410 --> 02:12:40,211
They cast a spell on you,
you know, theJews.

1436
02:12:40,310 --> 02:12:42,911
When you work closely with them,
like I do, you see this.

1437
02:12:43,011 --> 02:12:46,911
They have this power.
It's like a virus. Some of my men
are infected with this virus.

1438
02:12:46,911 --> 02:12:49,311
They should be
pitied, not punished.
They should receive treatment.

1439
02:12:49,311 --> 02:12:52,412
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

1440
02:12:52,412 --> 02:12:55,512
It's a matter of money 
Hmm ?

1441
02:12:55,611 --> 02:12:58,311
You're offering me
a bribe ?

1442
02:13:00,211 --> 02:13:05,211
A bribe ? No. No, please.
It's a gratuity.

1443
02:13:05,311 --> 02:13:07,211
Heil Hitler.!

1444
02:13:11,612 --> 02:13:13,911
Hello, Amon.

1445
02:13:16,512 --> 02:13:18,511
Sit down.

1446
02:13:21,311 --> 02:13:25,011
We give you Jewish girls
at five marks a day, Oskar.

1447
02:13:25,112 --> 02:13:27,112
You should kiss us,
not them.

1448
02:13:27,212 --> 02:13:31,312
God forbid you ever get
a real taste forJewish skirt.

1449
02:13:31,412 --> 02:13:34,811
There's no future in it.
They don't have a future.

1450
02:13:34,913 --> 02:13:39,812
That's not just good,
old-fashioned,Jew-hating talk.

1451
02:13:39,812 --> 02:13:42,712
It's policy now.

1452
02:13:44,001 --> 02:13:47,901
Ja, schoen gefangen ! Gut !

1453
02:13:53,601 --> 02:13:57,801
Nochmal,ja ! Schoen !

1454
02:14:27,802 --> 02:14:30,402
Also los ! Bewegung !

1455
02:14:30,503 --> 02:14:34,402
Schneller hier.!
Zack, zack, zack.!

1456
02:14:34,502 --> 02:14:36,802
Beweg deinen Arsch !

1457
02:14:36,903 --> 02:14:39,503
Das geht
auch schneller.!

1458
02:14:39,602 --> 02:14:42,602
Bewegt euch.!
Schlaft nicht ein.!

1459
02:14:42,602 --> 02:14:46,802
####
Nur die ganzen Fetzen,
nicht das Gemuese.!

1460
02:14:51,803 --> 02:14:53,803
Was ist denn hier los ?

1461
02:14:53,903 --> 02:14:56,603
Komm, das kannst du mit
den Haenden machen,
fass da vorn an.!

1462
02:14:56,603 --> 02:14:58,202
Hier.!

1463
02:14:58,303 --> 02:15:01,103
Los, raus mit den Fetzen.!
Die Kleinteile lass liegen.!

1464
02:15:01,103 --> 02:15:04,603
####

1465
02:15:10,403 --> 02:15:14,204
Jetzt macht aber schnell,
verdammt noch mal.!
Weg mit den Scheissdingern.!

1466
02:15:22,903 --> 02:15:26,503
So ist es.! Walhalla.!
Walhalla laeuft hier.!

1467
02:15:28,603 --> 02:15:31,703
####

1468
02:15:31,803 --> 02:15:34,104
Can you believe this ?

1469
02:15:34,203 --> 02:15:37,504
As if I don't have enough to do,
they come up with this ?

1470
02:15:37,604 --> 02:15:41,604
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

1471
02:15:41,604 --> 02:15:46,403
The party's over, Oskar.
They're closing us down,
sending everybody to Auschwitz.

1472
02:15:46,505 --> 02:15:48,905
When ?
I don't know. As soon as
I can arrange the shipments.

1473
02:15:49,004 --> 02:15:52,805
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

1474
02:15:55,004 --> 02:15:59,804
####

1475
02:16:13,005 --> 02:16:16,305
I've been talking to Goeth.
I know the destination.

1476
02:16:16,404 --> 02:16:19,304
These are
the evacuation orders.

1477
02:16:19,405 --> 02:16:22,206
I'm to help organize
the shipments, put myself
on the last train.

1478
02:16:22,206 --> 02:16:25,405
That's not what
I was going to say.

1479
02:16:25,505 --> 02:16:29,305
I made Goeth promise me
he'd put in a good word for you.

1480
02:16:29,406 --> 02:16:32,806
Nothing bad is going to happen
to you there. You'll receive
special treatment.

1481
02:16:32,905 --> 02:16:36,906
The directives coming in
from Berlin mention ''Special Treatment''
more and more often.

1482
02:16:37,005 --> 02:16:40,806
I'd like to think
that's not what you mean.
Preferential treatment.

1483
02:16:40,905 --> 02:16:46,405
- Do we have to invent
a whole new language ?
- I think so.

1484
02:16:47,805 --> 02:16:50,406
You're staying,
I take it.

1485
02:16:54,406 --> 02:16:58,806
In Krakow  What on earth for 
What for?
You have a business to run.

1486
02:16:58,806 --> 02:17:02,607
Of course, you'll have
to hire new workers.
Poles, I guess.

1487
02:17:02,706 --> 02:17:06,406
They cost
a little more, but--

1488
02:17:07,406 --> 02:17:09,807
What are you going to do ?

1489
02:17:13,706 --> 02:17:16,806
You run my business.

1490
02:17:19,006 --> 02:17:21,407
No, I'm going home.

1491
02:17:21,507 --> 02:17:27,007
I've done what I came here for.
I've got more money than any man
could spend in a lifetime.

1492
02:17:37,808 --> 02:17:42,907
Someday, this is all
going to end, you know.

1493
02:17:46,906 --> 02:17:49,707
I was going to say
we'll have a drink then.

1494
02:17:53,908 --> 02:17:57,507
I think I better
have it now.

1495
02:18:19,609 --> 02:18:22,407
##Bible says ##

1496
02:18:22,407 --> 02:18:26,108

1514
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:37,010
I don't understand.
I mean,you want these people ?

1515
02:19:37,110 --> 02:19:39,711
''These people''?
My people,
I want my people.

1516
02:19:39,810 --> 02:19:42,811
Who are you, Moses 
Come on, what is this ?

1517
02:19:42,911 --> 02:19:45,811
Where's the money in this 
Where's the scam ?
It's good business.

1518
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:48,211
It's good business
in your opinion.

1519
02:19:48,310 --> 02:19:52,411
You've got to move them,
the equipment, everything
to Czechoslovakia.

1520
02:19:52,511 --> 02:19:55,710
Pay for all that
and build another camp.
Doesn't make any sense.

1521
02:19:55,811 --> 02:19:59,010
Look, Amon--
It's good for me.
You're not telling me something.

1522
02:19:59,110 --> 02:20:01,911
I know them.
I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.

1523
02:20:02,011 --> 02:20:03,811
You're not telling me something.
It's good for you.
I'll compensate you.

1524
02:20:03,811 --> 02:20:06,711
That's right.
It's good for the Army.

1525
02:20:06,812 --> 02:20:09,311
You know what
I'm going to make 
What ?

1526
02:20:09,410 --> 02:20:11,711
Artillery shells.
Everyone is !

1527
02:20:11,811 --> 02:20:13,710
Tank shells,
they need that.
Tanks shells, ja.

1528
02:20:13,811 --> 02:20:16,311
Everybody's happy.
Except me.

1529
02:20:16,412 --> 02:20:19,411
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

1530
02:20:19,511 --> 02:20:22,512
If I'm making 1 00,
you've got to be making 300.

1531
02:20:22,611 --> 02:20:26,012
If you admit to 300,
then it's 400 actually.
But how ?

1532
02:20:26,012 --> 02:20:29,811
I just told you.
You did, but you didn't.

1533
02:20:31,112 --> 02:20:34,111
Ah, ja, all right,
don't tell me.

1534
02:20:34,111 --> 02:20:38,411
I'll go along with it.
It's just irritating
I can't work it out.

1535
02:20:38,512 --> 02:20:43,212
Look, all you have
to do is tell me
what it's worth to you.

1536
02:20:43,313 --> 02:20:46,012
What's a person
worth to you ?
No, no, no, no.

1537
02:20:46,111 --> 02:20:49,112
What's one worth to you ?

1538
02:20:57,013 --> 02:21:00,612
Poldek Pfefferberg.
Mila Pfefferberg.

1539
02:21:00,713 --> 02:21:04,112
And, uh--

1540
02:21:04,112 --> 02:21:06,113
Uh, Stagel, Stagel--

1541
02:21:06,213 --> 02:21:08,212
Paul.
Paul Stagel.

1542
02:21:08,212 --> 02:21:10,913
Doctor.

1543
02:21:10,913 --> 02:21:15,913
The investors.
I want all of them.
Yes, sir.

1544
02:21:15,913 --> 02:21:18,613
Uh, Fischer.
Ismail Fischer.

1545
02:21:18,713 --> 02:21:21,914
Fischer, Ismail.

1546
02:21:22,013 --> 02:21:25,013
Josef Scharf.
One moment, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

1547
02:21:25,113 --> 02:21:27,113
Come on, Stern.
Scharf, Scharf.

1548
02:21:30,213 --> 02:21:34,313
The children.
All the children.

1549
02:21:38,613 --> 02:21:40,514
Herbert Stier.
 Thank you.

1550
02:21:40,613 --> 02:21:44,814
How many ?
Four hundred, 450.

1551
02:21:47,413 --> 02:21:49,413
More, more.

1552
02:21:54,713 --> 02:21:57,314
Good morning.

1553
02:22:13,314 --> 02:22:18,715
Think of Feigenbaum,Jakob.
Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1554
02:22:22,915 --> 02:22:26,914
Lutek,Jakob,
Nacha. Yes ? Nacha.

1555
02:22:26,914 --> 02:22:28,915
Nacha, that's right.

1556
02:22:28,915 --> 02:22:31,615
And Wolf.

1557
02:22:31,714 --> 02:22:34,215
How many ?

1558
02:22:35,814 --> 02:22:39,215
Six hundred.
More.

1559
02:22:39,215 --> 02:22:42,015
You can do
the same thing I'm doing.

1560
02:22:42,015 --> 02:22:44,816
You might even
make money at it.
 I don't know.

1561
02:22:44,816 --> 02:22:47,615
Come on,Julius, I know
about the extra food
and clothes you give them.

1562
02:22:47,715 --> 02:22:50,815
Paid for out of your own pocket.
If we make a combined approach,

1563
02:22:50,914 --> 02:22:53,416
we could get more than
4,000 out, mine and yours.
Oskar--

1564
02:22:53,416 --> 02:22:56,815
We could relocate them
in something like safety,
in Moravia.

1565
02:22:56,915 --> 02:22:59,416
I don't know.

1566
02:23:01,616 --> 02:23:05,515
How many cigarettes
have you smoked tonight ?
Too many.

1567
02:23:05,616 --> 02:23:10,216
For every one--
you smoke, I smoke half.

1568
02:23:10,315 --> 02:23:12,916
I've done all I can.
I will not accept that.

1569
02:23:12,916 --> 02:23:16,216
No, Oskar,
I can't do anymore.
I will not accept that.

1570
02:23:16,316 --> 02:23:18,015
No.

1571
02:23:28,016 --> 02:23:30,716
How many  How many ?
Eight hundred and fifty,
give or take.

1572
02:23:30,817 --> 02:23:34,717
Give or take what, Stern 
Count them. How many ?

1573
02:23:45,317 --> 02:23:48,916
That's it.
You can finish that page.

1574
02:23:53,717 --> 02:23:57,617
What... did... Goeth...
say about this ?

1575
02:23:57,617 --> 02:24:01,517
You just told him how
many people you needed and--

1576
02:24:04,617 --> 02:24:06,917
You're not buying them.

1577
02:24:09,317 --> 02:24:12,418
You're buying them 
You're paying him
for each of these names ?

1578
02:24:12,517 --> 02:24:15,918
If you were still working
for me, I'd expect you
to talk me out of it.

1579
02:24:16,017 --> 02:24:19,417
It's costing me
a fortune.

1580
02:24:19,417 --> 02:24:23,517
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

1581
02:24:45,618 --> 02:24:47,819
Look.

1582
02:24:53,418 --> 02:24:57,618
The list is
an absolute good.

1583
02:24:57,719 --> 02:25:00,519
The list... is life.

1584
02:25:02,119 --> 02:25:07,520
All around its margins
lies the gulf.

1585
02:25:07,619 --> 02:25:11,519
Oskar, there's
a clerical error here
at the bottom of the last page.

1586
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:14,319
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1587
02:25:14,418 --> 02:25:18,919
I'll never fid a maid as well
trained as her at Brinnlitz.
They are all country girls.

1588
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:21,020
No.

1589
02:25:30,719 --> 02:25:32,619
No.

1590
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:34,819
One hand of 21 .
No.

1591
02:25:34,819 --> 02:25:37,820
If you win, I pay you
7,400 Reichsmark.
No.

1592
02:25:37,919 --> 02:25:41,320
Hit a natural,
I make it 1 4,800.
No.

1593
02:25:41,420 --> 02:25:44,320
If I win,
the girl goes on my list.

1594
02:25:44,419 --> 02:25:48,320
I can't wager Helen
in a card game.
Why not ?

1595
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:51,421
Wouldn't be right.
She's just going to Auschwitz
on Number Two anyway.

1596
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:54,121
What difference
does it make ?
She's not going to Auschwitz.

1597
02:25:54,220 --> 02:25:58,020
I'd never do that to her.
No, I want her to come back
to Vienna with me.

1598
02:25:58,120 --> 02:26:01,120
I want her to come
to work for me there.

1599
02:26:01,219 --> 02:26:05,721
I want to grow old
with her.
Are you mad ?

1600
02:26:05,821 --> 02:26:11,420
Amon, you can't take her
to Vienna with you.
No, of course I can't.

1601
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:15,121
That's what I'd like to do.

1602
02:26:15,121 --> 02:26:20,521
What I can do, if I'm
any sort of a man, is the
next most merciful thing.

1603
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:25,421
I should take her into the woods
and shoot her painlessly
in the back of the head.

1604
02:26:35,322 --> 02:26:38,922
What was it you said
for a natural 21 ?

1605
02:26:39,022 --> 02:26:42,322
Was it 1 4,800 ?

1606
02:26:42,421 --> 02:26:44,722
Schindlerjuden to these tables.!
Say your names clearly.

1607
02:26:45,721 --> 02:26:49,322
We are the family Dresner.
Juda,Jonas,

1608
02:26:49,322 --> 02:26:51,722
Donata and Chaja.

1609
02:26:51,821 --> 02:26:55,421
We are Rosners.
Henry, Manci--
And Leo.

1610
02:26:55,523 --> 02:26:57,623
And our son.
I am Olek.

1611
02:26:58,521 --> 02:27:00,421
Maria Mischel.

1612
02:27:00,522 --> 02:27:03,322
Chaim Nowak.

1613
02:27:03,322 --> 02:27:05,622
Wulkan, Markus.

1614
02:27:05,721 --> 02:27:07,622
Michael Lemper.

1615
02:27:09,223 --> 02:27:11,222
Itzhak Stern.

1616
02:27:11,323 --> 02:27:14,822
Rebeka and Josef Bau.

1617
02:27:14,822 --> 02:27:17,623
Rosalia Nussbaum.
Wilhelm Nussbaum.

1618
02:27:17,623 --> 02:27:20,422
Jakob Levartov.

1619
02:27:20,523 --> 02:27:23,323
Farber, Rosa.
Farber, Arje.

1620
02:27:23,323 --> 02:27:26,622
...Sara.
Friehof, Fischel.

1621
02:27:26,723 --> 02:27:29,423
Mietek Pemper.

1622
02:27:29,522 --> 02:27:32,323
Poldek and Mila Pfefferberg.

1623
02:27:32,323 --> 02:27:35,123
Horowitz, Dolek.

1624
02:27:35,123 --> 02:27:37,623
Adam Levy.

1625
02:27:37,723 --> 02:27:40,123
Marcel Goldberg.

1626
02:27:40,222 --> 02:27:43,323
Klipstein, Isak David.

1627
02:27:43,323 --> 02:27:45,723
Altmann, Eduard.

1628
02:27:45,723 --> 02:27:47,824
Grunberg, Miriam.

1629
02:27:47,923 --> 02:27:50,023
Luftig, Eliasz.

1630
02:27:50,123 --> 02:27:52,124
Hilmann, Eduard.

1631
02:27:52,223 --> 02:27:54,223
Erna Rothberg.

1632
02:27:54,223 --> 02:27:57,124
Zuckermann,Jetti.

1633
02:27:57,224 --> 02:27:59,524
Helen Hirsch.

1634
02:28:01,724 --> 02:28:05,624
The worst is over.

1635
02:28:05,723 --> 02:28:09,624
Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1636
02:28:09,724 --> 02:28:14,624
Be careful.
Men to this transport and
women to this transport.

1637
02:28:14,724 --> 02:28:19,024
Watch your step.
Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1638
02:28:57,426 --> 02:29:01,625
Wonderful, Olek, wonderful.

1639
02:29:01,625 --> 02:29:06,026
You know how we make
ice into water ?

1640
02:29:06,125 --> 02:29:09,425
Olek, get another one !

1641
02:29:47,726 --> 02:29:50,527
Alle in eine Einzelreihe
aufstellen !

1642
02:29:50,627 --> 02:29:55,927
You'll be pleased with
the level of efficiency
I get from these workers.

1643
02:29:57,627 --> 02:30:00,027
Budzyn, under my command,

1644
02:30:00,027 --> 02:30:03,227
was the envy
of every other commandant
in the labor camp system.

1645
02:30:03,326 --> 02:30:04,327
The prisoners,
however--
Excuse me.

1646
02:30:04,427 --> 02:30:07,227
They would have rather
been somewhere else.

1647
02:30:21,326 --> 02:30:25,327
The train with the women
has already left Plaszow...

1648
02:30:25,428 --> 02:30:28,928
and will be arriving
here very shortly.

1649
02:30:29,028 --> 02:30:31,727
I know you've had
a long journey.

1650
02:30:31,727 --> 02:30:35,029
But it's only a short walk
further to the factory...

1651
02:30:35,128 --> 02:30:40,527
where hot soup and bread
is waiting for you.

1652
02:30:40,628 --> 02:30:42,728
Welcome to Brinnlitz !

1653
02:30:52,328 --> 02:30:55,929
Beans in tsunt ?
 Beans are the best.

1654
02:30:55,929 --> 02:30:58,028
I don't like beans.

1655
02:30:58,129 --> 02:31:02,028
Beans and meat
and potatoes and bread.

1656
02:31:02,028 --> 02:31:04,229
That's not the way
you make tsunt.

1657
02:31:07,929 --> 02:31:11,328
Eggs in tsunt ?
Yes !

1658
02:31:14,029 --> 02:31:16,929
I don't like tsunt.
 No,you don't.

1659
02:31:16,929 --> 02:31:22,129
What do you like ?
I like caviar.

1660
02:31:22,229 --> 02:31:24,729
One day on the fire.

1661
02:32:30,530 --> 02:32:32,931
Alle vorm Wagen
in Position bleiben.

1662
02:32:34,430 --> 02:32:37,830
Alle in der Gruppe

1663

Wegbleiben vom Wagen.!
Wegbleiben vom Wagen.!

1664

Los, 'raus mit euch.
Zack, zack, zack ! 'Raus !

1670
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:15,432
Dreissig, fuenfunddreissig,

1671
02:33:15,532 --> 02:33:17,432

02:33:17,533 --> 02:33:19,932

1675
02:33:29,033 --> 02:33:32,832
Where are the listmakers 
Where are the tables ?

1676
02:33:35,733 --> 02:33:38,532
Move the line.!

02:33:38,633 --> 02:33:41,033
'Raus mit euch !

1678
02:33:41,132 --> 02:33:43,533
Hopp, hopp.!

Los, ein bisschen

1684
02:33:56,233 --> 02:33:59,133
Mama, where are we ?

1685
02:33:59,833 --> 02:34:03,533
Seventeen, 1 8, 20--
They're in Auschwitz.

1686
02:34:03,633 --> 02:34:06,933
The train was
never routed here.
Apaperwork mistake.

1687
02:34:14,233 --> 02:34:15,834
Szybciej ! Szybko !

02:37:59,039 --> 02:38:01,039
Blick hinunter.!

1706
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:06,641
Die Hand auf
die Schulter.!

1707
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:09,741
How old are you, Mother?
Sixty-eight.

1708
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:14,939
Cough for me, Mother.
They say to fall against
the fence is a kindness.

1709
02:38:15,041 --> 02:38:18,141
Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

1710
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:22,139
If you do, you'll never
know what happened to you.

1711
02:38:22,241 --> 02:38:26,541
How old are you,
Mother ?
Sixty-six, sir.

1712
02:38:26,541 --> 02:38:28,840
Sir ?
Good morning.

1713
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:31,841
A mistake has been made.
We are not supposed
to be here.

1714
02:38:31,940 --> 02:38:35,639
We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are SchindlerJews.

1715
02:38:35,740 --> 02:38:39,240
Who is Oskar Schindler ?
He had a factory
in Krakow.

1716
02:38:39,341 --> 02:38:43,740
Enamelware.
A potmaker.

1717
02:38:43,740 --> 02:38:45,940
How old are you, Mother ?

1718
02:38:50,542 --> 02:38:55,040
You are not
the only industrialist
who needs labor,

1719
02:38:55,141 --> 02:38:58,841
Herr Schindler.

1720
02:38:58,942 --> 02:39:01,842
I remember
earlier this year,
I.G. Farben ordered...

1721
02:39:01,941 --> 02:39:07,741
a trainload of Hungarians
for his chemical factory.

1722
02:39:07,841 --> 02:39:11,741
The train came in
through the archway,

1723
02:39:11,841 --> 02:39:17,041
and the officer in charge
of the selection went
immediately to work...

1724
02:39:17,141 --> 02:39:20,642
and sent 2,000
of them...

1725
02:39:20,741 --> 02:39:23,842
straightaway
to Special Treatment.

1726
02:39:23,942 --> 02:39:29,141
It is not my task
to interfere with the processes
that take place down here.

1727
02:39:30,941 --> 02:39:36,442
Why do you think I can
help you if I can't
help I.G. Farben ?

1728
02:39:36,442 --> 02:39:38,842
Allow me to express
the reason.

1729
02:39:48,242 --> 02:39:51,542
I'm not making
any judgment about you.

1730
02:39:51,642 --> 02:39:55,343
It's just that I know
that in the coming months...

1731
02:39:55,442 --> 02:39:59,643
we're all going
to need portable wealth.

1732
02:40:00,742 --> 02:40:03,443
I could have you arrested.

1733
02:40:03,543 --> 02:40:08,043
I'm protected
by powerful friends.
You should know that.

1734
02:40:11,243 --> 02:40:15,243
I do not say
I am accepting them.

1735
02:40:15,343 --> 02:40:20,143
All I say is,
I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

1736
02:40:34,043 --> 02:40:37,344
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

1737
02:40:37,443 --> 02:40:39,844
I'll cut you
300 units from it.

1738
02:40:39,844 --> 02:40:43,844
New ones.
These are fresh.

1739
02:40:47,544 --> 02:40:50,943
The train comes,
we turn it around.
Mmm, yes, yes.

1740
02:40:50,943 --> 02:40:53,244
It's yours.
I understand.

1741
02:40:53,344 --> 02:40:55,944
I want these.

1742
02:40:58,343 --> 02:41:01,244
You shouldn't
get stuck on names.

1743
02:41:09,045 --> 02:41:13,345
That's right. It creates
a lot of paperwork.

1744
02:41:13,844 --> 02:41:17,645
Zoldinger, Ernestina.!
Waldergrun, Hilda.!

1745
02:41:17,744 --> 02:41:19,944
Waldergrun, Leonora.!

1746
02:41:20,045 --> 02:41:23,445
Laast, Anna !
Pfefferberg, Mila !

1747
02:41:23,545 --> 02:41:27,045
Dresner, Chaja !
Dresner, Danka !

1748
02:41:27,144 --> 02:41:30,846
Nussbaum, Sidonia !
Rosner, Manci !

1749
02:41:30,945 --> 02:41:36,146
Hirsch, Helen.!
Grosz, Chaja Sara.!
Seelenfreund, Estella.!

1750
02:41:49,646 --> 02:41:53,946
Schneller laufen.!
Schneller laufen.! Schneller.!

1751
02:41:54,045 --> 02:41:58,145
Schneller.!
Schneller.!
Mach schon.! Voran.!

1752
02:42:00,246 --> 02:42:03,146
Los, los, los.!
Schneller.!

1753
02:42:04,947 --> 02:42:09,046
- Schneller !
- Bewegt euch !

1754
02:42:09,146 --> 02:42:12,246
Bojcie sie !
Bojcie sie !

1755
02:42:16,145 --> 02:42:20,446
No ! No ! No !

1756
02:42:24,947 --> 02:42:28,846
Maedchen, los jetzt aber !
Jetzt aber Tempo !

1757
02:42:34,846 --> 02:42:38,547
No ! No ! No !

1758
02:42:38,647 --> 02:42:42,147
Danka ! Danka ! Danka !

1759
02:42:42,246 --> 02:42:44,548
No ! No ! No !

1760
02:42:46,648 --> 02:42:50,147
Hey.! Hey.! Hey.!
What are you doing?

1761
02:42:50,248 --> 02:42:55,548
These are mine !
These are my workers !
They should be on my train !

1762
02:42:55,548 --> 02:42:58,248
They're skilled
munitions workers !
They're essential !

1763
02:42:58,248 --> 02:43:02,147
Essential girls !

1764
02:43:02,248 --> 02:43:07,548
Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings.

1765
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:11,548
How else am I
to polish the inside of
a .45 millimeter shell casing ?

1766
02:43:11,648 --> 02:43:15,448
You tell me.
You tell me !

1767
02:43:15,547 --> 02:43:20,348
Back on the train !
Back on the train !

1768
02:45:15,251 --> 02:45:19,651
Under Department ''W''
provisions,

1769
02:45:19,651 --> 02:45:24,051
it is unlawful to kill
a worker without just cause.

1770
02:45:24,151 --> 02:45:27,151
Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund,

1771
02:45:27,252 --> 02:45:31,552
I am entitled to file
damage claims for such deaths.

1772
02:45:31,651 --> 02:45:34,551
If you shoot
without thinking,

1773
02:45:34,652 --> 02:45:38,352
you go to prison,
I get paid.

1774
02:45:38,451 --> 02:45:41,152
That's how it works.

1775
02:45:41,152 --> 02:45:45,552
So, there will be no
summary executions here.

1776
02:45:47,352 --> 02:45:52,153
There will be no
interference of any kind
with production.

1777
02:45:52,252 --> 02:45:57,252
In hopes of ensuring that,
guards will no longer be
allowed on the factory floor...

1778
02:45:57,352 --> 02:46:00,852
without my authorization.

1779
02:46:05,853 --> 02:46:10,052
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

1780
02:46:11,153 --> 02:46:13,452
Come on, come.

1781
02:46:13,552 --> 02:46:15,953
Mensch, seitJahren hab' ich
so etwas nicht mehr gesehen.

1782
02:46:16,053 --> 02:46:19,753
Come on, boys, come.
Guck dir mal die Buddeln an !

1783
02:46:20,153 --> 02:46:24,752
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra,

1784
02:46:24,853 --> 02:46:28,753
sicut et nos dimittimus...

1785
02:46:28,853 --> 02:46:33,454
...quotidianum da nobis hodie,

1786
02:46:33,454 --> 02:46:38,153
et dimitte nobis
debita nostra...

1787
02:46:38,153 --> 02:46:41,653
sicut et nos dimittimus...

1788
02:46:41,753 --> 02:46:44,653
debitoribus nostris--

1789
02:46:44,753 --> 02:46:50,154
No doorman or maitre d'
will ever mistake you again.

1790
02:46:50,254 --> 02:46:52,753
I promise.

1791
02:46:52,854 --> 02:46:55,054
...sed libera nos a malo.

1792
02:46:56,754 --> 02:46:59,754
Itzhak.

1793
02:46:59,854 --> 02:47:03,655
This is Itzhak Stern,
my accountant. Itzhak--
You must be Mrs. Schindler.

1794
02:47:03,754 --> 02:47:06,253
It's a pleasure.
Emilie has volunteered
to work in the clinic.

1795
02:47:06,354 --> 02:47:08,254
Very generous
of you.
I know.

1796
02:47:08,354 --> 02:47:11,054
We need to talk
when you have a moment.

1797
02:47:11,054 --> 02:47:13,654
This is my wife, Stern.
I don't keep any secrets
from my spouse.

1798
02:47:13,754 --> 02:47:16,854
Oskar, please, attend
to business. It's much
more attractive.

1799
02:47:16,954 --> 02:47:18,854
Madam.
Hello.

1800
02:47:18,954 --> 02:47:21,554
What is it ?
We received an angry complaint
from the Armaments Board.

1801
02:47:21,655 --> 02:47:23,855
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings--

1802
02:47:23,855 --> 02:47:27,354
Apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.
That's to be expected.

1803
02:47:27,454 --> 02:47:30,954
Start-up problems.
This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.

1804
02:47:30,954 --> 02:47:32,554
I'll write them
a letter.
They're withholding payment.

1805
02:47:32,654 --> 02:47:36,854
Sure, so would I, so would you.
I wouldn't worry. We'll get it
right one of these days.

1806
02:47:36,854 --> 02:47:40,954
There's a rumor
you've been going around
miscalibrating the machines.

1807
02:47:41,655 --> 02:47:46,255
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

1808
02:47:46,955 --> 02:47:49,956
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

1809
02:47:50,055 --> 02:47:53,055
Pass them off as ours.
I don't see the difference
whether they're made here--

1810
02:47:53,155 --> 02:47:56,055
You don't see a difference ?
I see a difference.
You lose a lot of money.

1811
02:47:56,155 --> 02:47:59,455
Fewer shells will be made.
Stern, if this factory
ever produces...

1812
02:47:59,556 --> 02:48:04,956
a shell that can
actually be fired,
I'll be very unhappy.

1813
02:48:04,956 --> 02:48:07,956
Hello, madam.
How do you do ?

1814
02:48:21,456 --> 02:48:25,957
How are you doing,
Rabbi ? Rabbi !

1815
02:48:28,157 --> 02:48:30,057
Good, Herr Direktor.

1816
02:48:31,856 --> 02:48:34,357
Sun's going down.

1817
02:48:36,456 --> 02:48:39,056
Yes, it is.

1818
02:48:39,156 --> 02:48:42,857
What day is this 
Friday 
It is Friday, isn't it ?

1819
02:48:42,956 --> 02:48:45,056
Is it ?

1820
02:48:49,356 --> 02:48:54,456
What's the matter with you ?
You should be preparing
for the Sabbath.

1821
02:48:54,456 --> 02:48:57,657
Shouldn't you ?

1822
02:49:03,357 --> 02:49:08,156
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come.

What ?

1838
02:50:26,259 --> 02:50:31,260
Do you have any money,
uh, hidden away someplace...

1839
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:34,059
that I don't know about ?

1840
02:50:37,460 --> 02:50:39,959
No.

1841
02:50:44,360 --> 02:50:48,260
Why  Am I broke ?

1842
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:51,259
Uh--

1843
02:50:51,359 --> 02:50:54,260
Well--

1844
02:50:54,360 --> 02:51:00,061
Yesterday morning, at 24 1 a.m.,

1845
02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:04,760
at General Eisenhower's
headquarters,

1846
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:07,560
General Jodl...

1847
02:51:07,660 --> 02:51:11,260
signed the ''Act of
Unconditional Surrender''...

1848
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:13,860
of all German land,

1849
02:51:13,961 --> 02:51:17,861
sea and air forces
in Europe...

1850
02:51:17,960 --> 02:51:21,961
to the Allied
Expeditionary Force,

1851
02:51:21,961 --> 02:51:26,261
and simultaneously
to the Soviet High Command.

1852
02:51:26,360 --> 02:51:30,761
The German war is,
therefore, at an end.

1853
02:51:30,860 --> 02:51:32,860
But let us not forget
for a moment--

1854
02:51:32,860 --> 02:51:37,160
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

1855
02:51:37,262 --> 02:51:40,461
Japan, with all
her treachery and greed--

1856
02:51:40,461 --> 02:51:45,961
The unconditional surrender of
Germany has just been announced.

1857
02:51:46,061 --> 02:51:50,061
At midnight tonight,
the war is over.

1858
02:51:52,162 --> 02:51:54,963
Tomorrow you'll
begin the process...

1859
02:51:55,062 --> 02:51:58,362
of looking for survivors
of your families.

1860
02:52:01,262 --> 02:52:06,062
In most cases,
you won't find them.

1861
02:52:07,262 --> 02:52:10,762
After six long years
of murder,

1862
02:52:10,862 --> 02:52:16,262
victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

1863
02:52:16,362 --> 02:52:19,462
We've survived.

1864
02:52:19,462 --> 02:52:23,662
Many of you have come up
to me and thanked me.

1865
02:52:25,662 --> 02:52:27,863
Thank yourselves.

1866
02:52:29,063 --> 02:52:31,563
Thank your fearless Stern...

1867
02:52:31,662 --> 02:52:35,063
and others among you
who worried about you...

1868
02:52:35,063 --> 02:52:38,963
and faced death
at every moment.

1869
02:52:41,764 --> 02:52:44,562
I'm a member
of the Nazi party.

1870
02:52:44,562 --> 02:52:47,663
I'm a munitions
manufacturer.

1871
02:52:47,663 --> 02:52:50,363
I'm a profiteer
of slave labor.

1872
02:52:50,463 --> 02:52:54,162
I am a criminal.

1873
02:52:54,264 --> 02:52:59,863
At midnight you'll be free,
and I'll be hunted.

1874
02:52:59,963 --> 02:53:03,364
I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight.

1875
02:53:03,463 --> 02:53:06,764
After which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me,

1876
02:53:06,864 --> 02:53:08,864
I have to flee.

1877
02:53:11,564 --> 02:53:15,464
I know you have received orders
from our Commandant,

1878
02:53:15,464 --> 02:53:19,964
which he has received
from his superiors, to dispose
of the population of this camp.

1879
02:53:20,063 --> 02:53:23,264
Now would be
the time to do it.

1880
02:53:23,363 --> 02:53:28,864
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.

1881
02:53:33,264 --> 02:53:35,865
Or you could leave,

1882
02:53:35,964 --> 02:53:39,464
and return to
your families as men...

1883
02:53:39,564 --> 02:53:43,265
instead of murderers.

1884
02:54:23,165 --> 02:54:27,366
In memory of the countless
victims among your people,

1885
02:54:27,366 --> 02:54:31,466
I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.

Thank you, Mr.Jereth.
Thank you,

1900
02:55:29,568 --> 02:55:32,067
Thank you,

Thank you, Mr.Jereth.

1901
02:55:32,067 --> 02:55:34,466

1902
02:55:35,968 --> 02:55:37,867
Thank you, Mr.Jereth.

1903
02:55:56,168 --> 02:55:59,068
Thank you,
Mr.Jereth.

1904
02:56:23,168 --> 02:56:27,169
As soon as peace occurs,
I want...

1905
02:56:27,268 --> 02:56:31,169
um, I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

1906
02:56:31,269 --> 02:56:33,969
Two and a half meters each.

1907
02:56:34,069 --> 02:56:37,170
Also, each person is
to get a bottle of vodka.

1908
02:56:37,269 --> 02:56:40,169
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

1909
02:56:40,270 --> 02:56:43,769
Likewise for those
Egipshi cigarettes
we organized.

1910
02:56:43,870 --> 02:56:47,770
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.

1911
02:57:07,270 --> 02:57:10,969
We've written a letter,
trying to explain things...

1912
02:57:11,070 --> 02:57:13,370
in case
you are captured.

1913
02:57:16,070 --> 02:57:19,170
Every worker
has signed it.

1914
02:57:29,471 --> 02:57:31,370
Thank you.

1915
02:57:57,970 --> 02:58:00,771
It is Hebrew,
from the Talmud.

1916
02:58:00,871 --> 02:58:06,571
It says,
''Whoever saves one life,
saves the world entire.''

1917
02:58:45,472 --> 02:58:47,872
I could have got more out.

1918
02:58:50,173 --> 02:58:52,973
I could have got more.
I don't know.

1919
02:58:52,973 --> 02:58:55,473
If I just--

1920
02:58:55,473 --> 02:58:57,972
I could have got more.

1921
02:58:57,972 --> 02:59:03,272
Oskar, there are 1 ,1 00 people
who are alive because of you.
Look at them.

1922
02:59:03,272 --> 02:59:06,073
If I'd made more money.

1923
02:59:09,673 --> 02:59:14,972
I threw away so much money.

1924
02:59:15,074 --> 02:59:18,573
You have no idea.

1925
02:59:18,674 --> 02:59:20,773
If I had just--

1926
02:59:20,873 --> 02:59:25,273
There will be generations
because of what you did.

1927
02:59:25,374 --> 02:59:28,373
I didn't do enough.

1928
02:59:28,474 --> 02:59:31,874
You did so much.

1929
02:59:35,074 --> 02:59:37,274
This car.

1930
02:59:37,374 --> 02:59:39,673
Goeth would've
bought this car.

1931
02:59:39,673 --> 02:59:43,774
Why did I keep the car ?
Ten people right there.

1932
02:59:47,074 --> 02:59:49,675
Ten people.

1933
02:59:49,675 --> 02:59:51,775
Ten more people.

1934
02:59:54,875 --> 02:59:57,174
This pin.

1935
02:59:57,174 --> 03:00:00,975
Two people.

1936
03:00:01,074 --> 03:00:03,175
This is gold.

1937
03:00:03,175 --> 03:00:05,174
Two more people.

1938
03:00:05,174 --> 03:00:07,974
He would have given me
two for it; at least one.

1939
03:00:08,075 --> 03:00:11,475
He would have given me one,
one more.

1940
03:00:13,875 --> 03:00:17,875
One more person.

1941
03:00:17,875 --> 03:00:21,375
A person, Stern.

1942
03:00:21,375 --> 03:00:24,176
For this.

1943
03:00:26,076 --> 03:00:29,976
I could have gotten...

1944
03:00:30,075 --> 03:00:34,675
one more person
and I didn't.

1945
03:00:34,775 --> 03:00:38,775
And I-I didn't !

1946
03:02:06,678 --> 03:02:09,778
You have been liberated...

1947
03:02:09,877 --> 03:02:13,478
by the Soviet Army !

1948
03:02:20,379 --> 03:02:22,479
Have you been
in Poland ?

1949
03:02:22,578 --> 03:02:26,178
I just came from Poland.

1950
03:02:26,178 --> 03:02:29,278
Are there
anyJews left ?

1951
03:02:34,778 --> 03:02:37,278
Where should we go ?

1952
03:02:37,379 --> 03:02:39,678
Don't go east, that's for sure.

1953
03:02:39,779 --> 03:02:42,978
They hate you there.

1954
03:02:43,079 --> 03:02:46,779
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

1955
03:02:46,878 --> 03:02:50,978
We could use some food.

1956
03:02:51,079 --> 03:02:56,280
Isn't that a town
over there ?
